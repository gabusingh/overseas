      "floods or covid-19, india's 'invisible' migrant workers pay the highest price",
    Article:
      "may 8, 2020: twenty migrant labourers were trekking home along a railway track between jalna and aurangabad in maharashtra during the covid-19 lockdown. having walked 40 km, at 3.30 am they chose to rest on the railway track, assuming no trains were running. their destinations were far away, umaria and shahdol districts in madhya pradesh. soon after they slept off, 16 of them were run over and killed by a goods train.\nnot much later, in september 2020, in reply to a question in parliament, the union labour ministry stated that it had maintained no data or record of any migrant worker deaths during the lockdown, and so the question of providing relief to the surviving families \"does not arise\".\nit was absurd and tragic.\nthe images of the workers' chapattis, clothes and other personal items strewn on the railway tracks became the only 'record' that those 16 deaths did occur.\nfast forward to july 2023: thousands of migrant workers living in shanty colonies on the banks of the yamuna in delhi are homeless. flowing way above its 'danger mark' for days, the yamuna has again submerged their homes. thanks to climate change, this monsoon deluge is now more destructive.\nsince 1978, the yamuna has crossed the 207 metre mark three times, all in the last 10 years - 2013, 2019 and 2023.\neach time, the worst hit are delhi's migrant workers.\nevery year, crores of india's most vulnerable, most marginalised, and most 'invisible' socio-economic group - internal migrant workers - suffer the most due to natural and man-made disasters. they are ignored by their home states and their host states. most of them are from india's minority communities, or india's scheduled castes and tribes. eight of the men run over by the goods train in 2020 were gond adivasis. unfortunately, as most migrant workers can't even exercise their vote, they also lack that last bit of clout over the political class and the sarkari babu , that other indians have.\nfirst, let's be clear, we are talking about a vast number of fellow indians.\na 2014 study estimated that india has a 100 million temporary internal migrant workers, with roughly 50% 'intra-state' and 50% 'inter-state' migrant workers. as india's population has risen by almost 10% since 2014, the number today should be around 110 million. the study also estimated that india's internal migrant workers contributed 10% to the national gdp. an irony, because they get very little back.\nafter maharashtra, the delhi national capital region (ncr) hosts india's second highest population of migrant workers - factory hands, loaders, rickshaw pullers, street vendors, masons, security guards, cleaners, gig workers, domestic helps - all barely scraping a living. work in the unorganised and informal sector means zero job security. migrant workers often work for less than minimum wages, work long hours, and work in unsafe conditions.\napart from employers, they are also exploited by middlemen and labour contractors on whom they rely to find work. with very little to survive on, the yamuna's floodplains offer the cheapest real estate to them. and so, most residents in the shanty colonies on the yamuna floodplains, and on the margins of the scores of 'nallahs' that wind towards the yamuna, are migrant workers.\nliving conditions here are highly inadequate - these shanty colonies are over-crowded, with little access to sanitation, water, electricity. despite being far more vulnerable to disease in such unhygienic conditions, migrant workers have poor access to healthcare facilities. they also know the yamuna floods almost every monsoon, but are forced to take their chances. and almost every year, they endure a cycle of flooding, packing their belongings and slumming it on delhi's pavements for weeks, and then having no choice but to rebuild their shanties on the same floodplain.\nwhat migrant workers went through during the covid-19 pandemic, should have been a tipping point, pushing state governments and the central government to finally think of ways to improve their lives, but that has simply not happened. stranded workers action network (swan), a volunteer group that provided relief to migrant workers during the pandemic, also compiled their testimonies. their report about what migrant workers faced during the pandemic's deadly second wave in april and may 2021, reveals just how vulnerable migrant workers can be.\nfor instance, the report says that 82% of the workers had just two days of rations left at the time that swan reached them. as many as 76% of them had just rs 200 left with them, 92% had not received any money from their employer after work stopped and 56% of the workers had been without work for more than a month.\nfurther evidence that we remain unmoved despite being aware of the hardships faced by migrant workers, is the cut in mgnrega spend in the 2023-24 union budget. the fact is that the needs of migrant workers are known. almost all of them work without a contract, which makes them vulnerable. most migrant workers are not unionised, which makes them further vulnerable. they also need an urban employment guarantee system and a system of wage support or social security in the event of job loss. a strong grievance redressal system that deters employers is also needed. so, why have these needs not been addressed over the years?\na key reason is the lack of political or electoral clout.\nas many as 60% of migrant workers don't return home and vote in national elections, often skipping state elections too. but they are aware of the power of their vote, many of them choosing to return to vote for local elections. a 2012 study showed that a robust 78% of migrant voters even had voter i-cards for their home constituency. their absence is even reflected in the voter turnout figures for up and bihar, the most prolific migrant worker 'sender' states. in the 2019 lok sabha polls, bihar and up had among the lowest voter turnouts at 57% and 59% respectively, below the national average of 67.4%.\nalso read: why there's no one left to vote in north bengal's tea gardens\nwhile some migrant workers prefer to retain their home state vote, those who want to vote from their 'host' state, often run into red tape, unable to provide proof of residence. many migrant workers, for instance, rickshaw pullers simply live on and around their rickshaws. while construction workers often shift from one work site to another. india's hundreds of thousands of migrant workers are 'invisible' politically. their inability to vote keeps them from forming an electoral block, whose interests the politicians would then be pressured to serve.\nas a matter of fact, the election commission already has solutions for these hurdles, but has just not applied them to india's migrant workers. india's 'netas' too, are guilty of not pressing hard enough. after all, providing for the migrant workers as 'host' states or cities, after they acquired political heft, would be an additional fiscal challenge, and a lot of additional work.\nfor instance, for india's homeless, the election commission has provided for verification via local block officers. a similar solution could be provided to migrant workers as well. and for migrant workers preferring to retain their home state voter status, the ec could give them access to the already existing system of electronically-transmitted postal ballot (etpb). in 2019, the etpb option was provided to 18 lakh defence personnel across india. there is also a proposal to give such a 'remote voting' option to nris across the world as well. why not provide the same to migrant workers?\nsuch measures will ensure that migrant workers are heard by politicians and government servants in the cities that they contribute so much to. even the option of voting remotely in their home state, will force politicians to push for their demands in their host states and cities.\nthat's when india's migrant workers will have some chance of being more 'visible', more 'heard'.\nrohit khanna is a journalist and video storyteller. he has been managing editor at the quint, and is a two-time ramnath goenka award winner.",
    Summary:
      "Migrant workers are homeless in the unorganised and informal sector of India's delhi national capital region.

estimates are unknown, but as many as 40-100 million of these workers are estimated to migrated for employment to india's cities each year. in march 2020, millions left the cities and returned to the indian countryside, reeling from lost employment, accommodation and poverty during india's covid-19 lockdowns.\nindian policymakers responded to the challenges faced by these migrants with new welfare schemes, including access to free food grains, affordable rental housing and opportunities for training. in 2023, india's economic growth appears to be resuming. gdp growth is projected to be 7 per cent over the 2022-23 fiscal year. the international monetary fund refers to india as a 'bright spot' in the world economy. urban migrant-receiving sectors such as construction and transportation appear to be poised for a comeback.\nbut it is uncertain how india's internal migrants will navigate these opportunities. there is almost no data available to study this population. india's national labour market surveys were discontinued in 2016. in 2018, india's government also discontinued the labour bureau's quarterly enterprise surveys. the government now relies on limited surveys from the periodic labour force survey that gathers short-term data for selected urban areas. private entities, such as the centre for monitoring indian economy, produce estimates of unemployment that seem at odds with the economic trends reported by the government.\nevidence from small studies suggests that migrants suffered significant losses during the covid-19 pandemic. analysis from the international labour organization found that indians aged 15-64 lost an average of 14.6 per cent and 6.3 per cent of their work hours in 2020 and 2021 respectively -- nearly double the global rate. another study showed that formal workers' wages fell 3.6 per cent and informal workers' wages fell 22.6 per cent.\nthere is also evidence that migrants are scared to return to the cities despite the losses they incurred. a longitudinal study found that while some male migrants have returned and even recovered their pre-pandemic incomes, many men have chosen to remain in rural areas, despite earning just 23 per cent of their previous income on average. women migrants have regained less than 65 per cent of their pre-pandemic incomes regardless of where they are.\nindia's labour market has also changed since the pandemic. some migrants find that their old jobs are not paying what they used to. a complicating factor here is that india does not have a uniform minimum wage. india's economic survey 2018-19 acknowledged that there are 1915 different minimum wages defined for various scheduled job categories across multiple states.\na new proposal that would limit the number of unique minimum wage rates to between 4-12 per state has not yet been passed. in the absence of a guarantee, a worker who returns to the city in search of employment may lack the confidence or negotiating power to bargain for higher wages.\nthere is also the possibility that expanded welfare programs could discourage migration. the government is in the midst of launching a new registration systems for unorganised workers. it has also rolled out new health insurance and social security schemes for them. india's largest public works program, the mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee act, was also expanded. evidence suggests that these safety nets are helpful, but coverage is still an issue -- only 24 per cent of indians have access to even one such scheme. it is unlikely that these schemes will provide long-term economic security.\nultimately, the issues of missing data, vulnerability to job losses, eroded negotiating power and limited access to safety nets may stem from migrants' lack of political organisation. according to india's electoral rules, eligible voters can only vote in their 'ordinary place of residence'. most short-term migrants are unable to vote in their home constituencies. this leads to large-scale disenfranchisement and disempowerment. until the images of desperate migrants walking home from cities went viral in march 2020, migrants were at the margins of politics and policy.\nhere, a real bright spot for india's migrant workers has recently emerged. on 28 december 2022, india's election commission announced its intentions to pilot remote voting for domestic migrants, enabling them to vote in their home states. the key innovation here is a remote electronic voting machine that can verify voter identities and record votes for multiple constituencies. the machines are new and many of the details are yet to be worked out. but with sufficient oversight and accountability, migrants could emerge as an important voting bloc. this is a positive development for india's rural migrants and indian participatory democracy.\nshareen joshi is associate professor in the edmund a walsh school of foreign service at georgetown university.",
    Summary:
      "As many as 40-100 million of these workers are estimated to migrate for employment to india's cities each year. Urban migrant-receiving sectors such as construction and transportation appear to be poised for a comeback. In march 2020, millions left the cities and returned to the indian countryside, reeling from lost employment, accommodation and poverty. There is almost no data available to study this population.

      "for a breath of dignity: the 'unfreedom' of india's caste-driven labour migration",
    Article:
      "\"turn in any direction you like; caste is the monster that crosses your path.\" this stirring image from br ambedkar's annihilation of caste, continues to ring true almost nine decades later. sitting in sunil ram's courtyard in kharat village in june 2022, we were immediately reminded of this. ram lives in araria, one of the poorest districts in bihar.\nevery year, parts of araria get flooded. during the monsoon, residents of kharat have to wade through knee-deep water to reach their homes. after the flood waters subside, ram and khairat's other dalit residents rebuild their bamboo and mud huts every year.\nram is an unlettered landless labourer. he works for two months each year in araria, then migrates to ludhiana in punjab for agriculture work and then to haryana or himachal pradesh for construction work. the destinations and work may change each year.\nthis is the story of many dalit men in bihar. they are among the 100 million labourers who work seasonally and circulate between their rural homes and far-away worksites in more developed parts of the country at different times of the year.\nfor most rural migrants from bihar, much of this migration has continued to be circular. a large number of dalits who leave their villages like ram do not make \"aspirational arrivals\" in the city. labour migration is actually labour circulation. caste remains central to this circulation and capitalism in india.\ncredit: surabhi singh.\ndalits and adivasis are preponderant in the temporary labour migrant workforce across the country. while they form only 25% of the population, official estimates show that they make up more than 40% of the seasonal migrants. temporary or seasonal labour migration within india is seven times greater than permanent migration and is up to 16 times the volume of permanent migration for dalits and adivasis. they are often employed in the most hazardous, punishing and polluting of all work in the economy.\namong brick kiln workers, 95% of whom are rural, 48.7% of all migrant workers are dalits and 16.1% are adivasis. they are categorically excluded from certain jobs by explicit discrimination and stigmatisation. studies from western india show that despite a shortage of skilled labour, a dalit or an adivasi labourer has little chance of getting skilled or better-paid work even after 25 years of work on construction sites, in stone quarries, lime fields and brick kilns.\nin tamil nadu's tiruppur garment industry, for example, dalits are more likely to find work in the low-skill, dirty, dyeing units, and non-dalits in the skilled tailoring sections. describing their situation while working as cane cutters in gujarat, adivasi and dalit migrant said that \"even dogs are better off\" than them.\ndespite the most demanding work conditions, dalit labourers in araria believed that their condition today is better than their ancestors' who had \"no option but to be beggars or bonded labourers to the upper caste zamindars\". this is how ram put it:\n\"our life is good now. we are free to work anywhere. we don't have to depend on these ... (uses a cuss word). for my father, the zamindar was the only employer. saying 'no' was never an option. our ancestors suffered a lot. the brahman never paid us. the others got rs 50-rs 60 but we were given rice. what can rice buy us? now we don't need these zamindars. we have the thekedar/contractor. he loans me money. he gives me work outside. i am not dependent on the landlord for my survival.\"\nunfreedom however, has not disappeared for dalits. their historical powerlessness vis-a-vis dominant social groups continues to mark their livelihoods even when they move beyond the bounds of the historically repressive village into the wider informal economy.\nneoliberalism has made informalisation even more rigid in what was already an overwhelmingly informal workforce: barely 8% of the indian workforce is in the formal sector, with the remaining 92% in the informal sector. some estimate this figure to be as high as 96% of the total workforce in india. this overwhelming percentage suggests that the informality of labour has become systemic, a central component of india's growth story. low-wages, insecure jobs, violence, poor work conditions and no space to unionise have become the norm.\nhistorical inherited inequalities legitimise the lower access dalits have to land, capital, education and political clout than other social groups and also sanction their relegation to low-end work. the size of informal workers is the highest among dalits at about 84% as against 54% for dominant castes. the average daily wage earnings of dalit informal workers was rs 269, much lower than upper castes for whom it is rs 357 and the national average of rs 315, according to the government's periodic labour force survey for 2018-'19.\ncredit: surabhi singh.\nlabour dispensability and informalisation play a crucial role in current processes of globalisation. social protection policies in the neoliberal and anti-labour regime are formulated on a sedentary conception of citizenship.\ncrucial elements of citizenship, such as vote, affirmative action, the right to food and the like, are invalidated the moment labourers leave their states. the state and capital seem to work in tandem in extracting from the intergenerational vulnerability of the poor and using caste to not just divide labour but also divide labourers. centuries of inequality of inheritance diminishes the scope of overall growth and it certainly does not seem to correct itself automatically.\nonly a narrative informed by the cultural economy of caste can explain why dalits like sunil ram consider the debt-induced dependency on dominant caste landowners in the home village for survival and the immobility, more humiliating than 10-14 hours per day of work in pitiable work conditions outside the home village.\narun kumar is a researcher and social change professional based out of london. his twitter handle is @arunkumarmumbai. diksha shriyan is a researcher and social change professional in mumbai. her twitter handle is @diksha_21.",

      'indian workers in the gulf file 1 labour complaint a day, on average',
    Article:
      'thiruvananthapuram: thirty-five-year-old paulson johnson from kerala has stopped sending emails to the qatar government, global labour organisations, and the indian embassy regarding his unpaid salary and end-of-service benefits. a day before onam, the harvest festival of kerala, he called me and said that he has lost hope and will not run after anyone for his hard-earned money.\nthe region has the highest global share of migrant workers as a proportion of the total workforce, reaching 41.4% in 2019 compared to the global average of just 5%. according to the ministry of external affairs, there are 13 million non-resident indians (migrant workers and migrant entrepreneurs) all over the world, of which nearly nine million are in the gcc.\nthe international labor organization global estimates of international migrant workers reveal that the number of migrant workers in 12 arab states amounts to 24.1 million in 2019, representing 14% of all migrant workers worldwide. the 12 arab states are the six gcc countries plus iraq, jordan, lebanon, occupied palestinian territory, syrian arab republic, and yemen.\naccording to the united nations department of economics and statistics ( un desa ), as of july 2023, there are 281 million migrants all over the world, which is 3.6% of the world population.\nlimited access to justice, weak and inefficient dispute settlement mechanisms, and the absence of compensation schemes also have a negative impact on migrant workers. additionally, in some countries, migrant workers have limited or no freedom of association and are unable to bargain collectively.\nthe non-inclusion or partial inclusion of certain categories of migrant workers, such as domestic workers, in labour laws is also a problem. while salary is ensured through bank transfer, freedom of movement and other rights limiting work to eight hours and access to health are often compromised.\nin these countries of destination, especially in the gulf, migrant workers face poor working conditions and substantial occupational safety and health deficits, combined with weak labour inspection in migrant-intensive sectors such as construction and domestic work.\nin addition to abusive and fraudulent recruitment practices and the high costs associated with labour migration in the countries of origin, workers who migrate to the gulf cooperation council countries (oman, saudi arabia, united arab emirates, kuwait, qatar, bahrain) face labour and workers\' rights violations as they follow an exploitative employer-employee labour contract system called kafala , which has resemblances to modern-day slavery.\n"repatriating a patient needs a lot of money and involves a lot of paperwork," george varghese, an indian social worker handling mohan\'s case in abu dhabi, told indiaspend . "and if it is of a worker whose company is not supportive, then everything will be in a mess."\nthen, there are the likes of bimal jacob mohan, who has been in coma in a hospital after a stroke suffered in january 2022, waiting to be repatriated home, which is now being coordinated by social workers.\nif paulson\'s and praveen\'s cases relate to unpaid salary, there are cases like that of suresh s., an indian security guard in qatar, who is sticking to his work despite being abused physically and mentally only because there are no other options.\n"now, even getting food for the day has become a problem," praveen told indiaspend . "some charitable organisations are providing us with food. we heard that the owner, an indian, has fled oman. no one tells us anything."\nthis is not an isolated instance. praveen p.p., another keralite, is stuck in oman since 2021, waiting to get unpaid salary and end-of-service benefits amounting to $11,605 (rs 9.6 lakh), from the construction company he worked for. praveen and his friends, who are also in a similar situation, had approached the omani and indian authorities, but with no success.\npaulson is owed $9,000 (rs 7.5 lakh) as pending salary and end-of-service benefits. he and his 18 friends, most of them in mid-level posts, are cumulatively owed $126,000 (rs 1.05 crore). since march, they have been knocking on the doors of the indian government, the qatar government and global labour organisations, but all their efforts have been in vain.\n"when i went there, it was just bare land. we built the stadium, which can host 32,000 spectators. we worked for 11 hours every day, but were paid for only 8 hours, and the lunch break was only 15 minutes," paulson said. "after everything was done, they threw us out empty-handed, violating all contract norms. we were forced to return in march 2022."\npaulson had migrated to qatar in 2011. he joined as an excavator operator for a monthly salary of $486 (equivalent to about rs 26,000 back then) at bin omran trading and co. in 2015, he was moved to the fifa 2022 project on an increased salary. he was in the team that built al bayt stadium, which hosted the fifa 2022 opening match between qatar and ecuador.\narchaic laws\ndespite being the largest migrant-sending and remittance-receiving country , india governs migration with a 40-year-old emigration act which leaves the migrant worker at risk. in 2019, there was an attempt to update the act, but it failed to get parliament\'s approval. two years later, a fresh version came in the form of the emigration bill 2021 .\nsuggestions were sought from the public and civil society organisations, but not much has been heard about it since then. during the parliament session in march 2023, the ministry of external affairs acknowledged the need for an updated emigration act to handle migration-related issues. but it stated that the ministry was still in the process of creating a preliminary version of the emigration bill after consulting with all concerned parties.\nother than dabbling with the emigration act, the indian government has shown less interest in signing and ratifying key global conventions meant to protect migrant workers and their families. india hasn\'t signed or ratified the international convention on the protection of the rights of all migrant workers and members of their families (cmw)--an international treaty that sets out the rights of migrant workers and their families that was adopted by the united nations general assembly in 1990 and came into force in 2003.\nthe cmw applies to all migrant workers and members of their families, regardless of their migration status. it guarantees them a wide range of rights including the right to life, liberty, and security of person; the right to work; the right to education; the right to healthcare; and the right to freedom of association. the cmw also prohibits discrimination against migrant workers and their families. it requires state parties to take measures to protect migrant workers from exploitation and abuse.\nthe cmw is an important instrument for protecting the rights of migrant workers and their families. however, it has not been widely ratified--only 58 states have ratified the convention. none of the six gulf cooperation council (gcc) countries have ratified the cmw, and neither has india.\nsimilarly, india hasn\'t signed or ratified ilo convention 189 (domestic workers convention) which extends rights such as paid leave, minimum wages and employment contracts to domestic workers. india has also not signed or ratified ilo convention 87 (migration for employment convention). c187 guarantees the freedom of association and protection of the right to organise. the convention belongs to the eight fundamental ilo conventions for the protection of labour rights. the convention safeguards the rights of both employees and employers to freely organise.\nindia has adopted the global compact for migration 2018 , but with reservations: the indian government upheld its sovereign right to decide who is a regular migrant and who is an irregular migrant. the global compact is the first inter-governmentally negotiated agreement, prepared under the auspices of the united nations, covering all dimensions of international migration in a holistic and comprehensive manner.\nit is a non-binding document that respects states\' sovereign right to determine who enters and stays in their territory and demonstrates commitment to international cooperation on migration. it presents a significant opportunity to improve the governance of migration, to address the challenges and to strengthen the contribution of migrants and migration to sustainable development.\nindiaspend reached out to the ministry of external affairs for comment on the emigration laws and the issues faced by indian workers in these countries. we will update this story when we receive a response.\nindia puts labour on the back burner\nmini mohan, a migrant rights researcher, told indiaspend, "if india signs global conventions on migration, that would save migrants from risk of exploitation.\n"additionally, if india pushes labour welfare in global platforms like the colombo process, bali process, abu dhabi dialogue and south asian association for regional cooperation (saarc), that would also help indian migrants in the gulf and other countries."\nthe platforms mentioned by mohan convene periodically to discuss labour migration in south asia, asia pacific and the arab gulf. migrant-sending and -receiving countries come together on such platforms.\nmohan points out that the ministry of external affairs should give some importance to labour issues. "currently they focus on trade. labour comes second," she said.\nuntil 2016, the ministry of overseas indian affairs (moia), a separate entity, looked after indians abroad. however, in 2016, after the bharatiya janata party (bjp)-led coalition came to power, it merged the moia with the ministry of external affairs (mea). rights activists claim that this was a bad move that has led to a decreased focus on migrant labour issues.\nrafeek ravuther, a migrant rights activist who for two decades has been running a television programme named pravasalokam on kairali, a malayalam tv channel headed by film actor mammootty and backed by the communist party of india marxist, to find missing indian migrants all over the world, told indiaspend that lack of effective pre-departure programmes, which is the first stage of migration, leads to trouble for migrant workers.\n"in the past, we used to see tv advertisements on safe migration," ravuther said. "but now they are missing. and the government is not reaching out to potential migrants in rural india to sensitise and guide them."\nravuther pointed out that there are thousands of fake recruitment agencies who lure the potential migrants with false promises and traffic them. "when a migrant reaches the destination country, with faults in the first stage of migration which is recruitment, then from there on various issues will start putting the migrant worker in a difficult situation."\nkuwait the worst offender\nthe mea\'s replies to a series of right to information (rti) queries reveal that indian migrant workers in the gulf cooperation council (gcc) countries are in a difficult situation, facing various labour and human rights violations.\nsince 2019, till june 30, 2023, the indian embassies in bahrain, oman, kuwait, united arab emirates, qatar and saudi arabia together received 48,095 labour complaints from the indian migrant workers.\nkuwait topped the list with 23,020 complaints, followed by saudi arabia with 9,346 complaints. oman is in third place with 7,666 complaints, the uae is in fourth place with 3,652 complaints, bahrain is fifth with 2,702 complaints, and qatar is sixth with 1,709 complaints.\nthe indian embassy in kuwait lists non-payment of wages, unfair working conditions (including lack of proper food) and harassment as the most common complaints from indian migrant workers. the saudi indian embassy lists salary issues, exit issues, and renewal of work permits. the omani indian embassy says that salary issues and repatriation are the major problems faced by indian migrant workers there. the uae indian embassy lists wage issues, repatriation, and retention of passports. the bahraini indian embassy cites wage issues, repatriation, and violation of local labour laws as the most common complaints. the qatari indian embassy also cites wage issues, passport retention, and visa issues as the most common complaints.\nall the issues cited by the indian embassies in the gcc are signs of forced labour as defined by ilo , which states that various indicators can be used to ascertain when a situation amounts to forced labour, such as restrictions on workers\' freedom of movement, withholding of wages or identity documents, physical or sexual violence, threats and intimidation or fraudulent debt from which workers cannot escape.\nlateefh thechy, a social worker in saudi arabia for the past 30 years, told indiaspend that the numbers indicated in the rtis are just the tip of the iceberg. "out of every 100, only 10 may be able to go to the embassy and file a complaint because the risk factors after filing a complaint are scary," lateefh said.\nlateefh said that a worker filing a complaint could be physically abused by the employer, and could lose their shelter and further protection. "workers will be far from the indian embassy," he pointed out. "those who have the money to reach the embassy and the courage to fight a case against the employer will be the only ones filing a complaint."\nthe number of complaints per year in qatar and the uae since 2019 are below 500 and 1,000, respectively. qatar began reforming its exploitative kafala labour system in 2018, which could be cited as a reason for the low number of cases. the uae has also introduced several reforms to the kafala system, encouraging more skilled migrants to work in the emirates. such reforms may be a reason for the smaller number of labour complaints in the uae.\nnews dailies in the region report that other gulf countries in the region are also trying to eliminate the kafala system, introduce a minimum wage, make it easier for migrant workers to change jobs, and provide them better protection for migrant workers.\nthe number of labour complaints at the kuwaiti indian embassy however reveals that the situation there is worse when compared to its neighbours. the cases ranged between 3,965 and 5,660 between 2019 and 2022. and this year, as of june, the number of cases has already reached 3,770.\nindia\'s two-passport problem\nsister josephine valarmathi, director of the national domestic workers movement (ndwm) in tamil nadu, an organisation involved in issues relating to indian migrant workers, said that the gcc countries are trying reforms but india is still stuck in 1983. "we still have two passports," valarmathi points out. "we are least bothered about low paid workers. we don\'t talk about them and try to elevate their status and protect their rights even when the destination countries are initiating reforms."\nin india, there are two types of passports: ecr and ecnr. ecr stands for "emigration check required", while ecnr stands for "emigration check not required". the government of india categorises passport holders into two categories based on their educational qualifications and professional skills. this categorisation ensures that people with lower educational qualifications or limited skill sets can avoid fraudulent recruitment agents or employers.\nindividuals who have passed grade x or higher, are taxpayers and have filed an income tax return for the previous three years with an average annual income of rs 10 lakh or more, are eligible for an ecnr passport. individuals who do not meet any of the above criteria are considered eligible for an ecr passport.\necr passport holders are required to obtain clearance from the protector of emigrants (poe) if they are traveling to any of the 18 countries, including six gcc countries, which the indian government considers to have labour laws that are not friendly to migrant workers.\nfor ecr passport holders, the clearance from the poe is obtained by submitting various documents, including employment contracts, visas, and travel tickets. the poe checks these documents thoroughly to ensure that the individual is traveling overseas for genuine employment purposes and is not duped by fraudulent recruitment agents or employers.\nin short, an indian who has not passed grade x and wants to migrate to one of the gcc countries must go through a number of strict measures to ensure safe migration. the laws are even stricter for women.\nan indian social worker in kuwait, who requested anonymity, said that it is india, and not the destination countries, that should be held responsible for the woes of indian workers in the gulf. the social worker said that if india does its part by signing global conventions, following them strictly, updating the emigration laws and refreshing the mous with countries of destination to ensure safe, orderly, and regular migration, the worker will be safe, happy, and productive, which will benefit both the destination country and india.\nwe welcome feedback. please write to respond@indiaspend.org. we reserve the right to edit responses for language and grammar.',

    Title: 'when people choose to migrate',
    Article:
      "liby johnson is the executive director of gram vikas, odisha. he has led large-scale poverty eradication efforts in his 25+ years of social development work across the diverse sectors of water, sanitation, livelihoods, disaster management, and community institutions. he has worked with grassroots development organisations, government programmes, and the united nations. less ... more\nin india, rural-urban migration is still seen as a distress-driven choice and not a voluntary one. this leads to a lack of policy measures to ensure safe and dignified migration for workers.\nthere are various reasons why people migrate from their source (home village, town, or city) to their destination (place of work). one is when individuals who have access to economic resources and a wide social network shift to other countries to set up businesses or for jobs. systems and policies promote this type of migration substantially, and it's often seen as wealth creation.\ntwo is distress migration, usually considered a coping mechanism at the source region by poorer populations. in india, this is often observed in the rural-urban migration patterns, which could be a result of the failure of people's primary occupation at source such as agriculture, or due to natural disasters and other factors. in this case, people are forced to migrate, and the reason for migration is seen as something that needs to be prevented.\nthe third kind of migration occurs when people migrate voluntarily from rural india to cities, driven by the aspiration to grow economically and socially. this form of migration is similar to the first type in that it is driven by knowledge about better opportunities outside the source area as well as one's desire and ability to take advantage of those. in this case, migrants look for opportunities in urban labour markets, which may offer higher wages, better working conditions, and more significant career prospects.\nthis last pattern is extremely common in odisha, with migration being a source of livelihoods for many.\nthe ganjam-surat district is one of the major labour migration corridors in the country. over the past 10 years, in jagannathprasad block in southern odisha, 57.2 percent people have stayed for work outside the district for a period of 30 or more days continuously (as of data from 2020). the baliguda block in kandhamal district too has a significant proportion of indigenous communities that depend on migration as a means of livelihood--more than 36 percent of the households in the block have at least one person migrating for work outside the district. for those migrating, their primary occupation is often the one they have at the destination.\nwhat has this meant for villages?\nin the case of odisha, in many blocks, we have estimated the annual remittance to be equal to what the government is spending in that block on 'development'. migrant workers earn approximately inr 6,000 in the beginning when they start to work in destination towns/cities, and graduate to inr 25-28,000 per month over time. of this, they are able to remit inr 10-12,000 a month to their homes, which is a substantial amount of money. this has led to significant social, cultural, and economic changes in their home villages.\nimproved standard of living\nan increase in disposable incomes because of high remittances enables migrant workers to invest in the improvement of their houses, and lease more land. people who are semi-skilled get the opportunity to gain knowledge through working at the destination, which they utilise to make better investments and financial decisions back home. some workers, for instance, choose to invest their money in setting up or buying small shops, rice mills, and autorickshaws in their home locations, which are run by family and friends, creating an additional source of income.\nimproved social status\nmigration to new places is reshaping traditional sociocultural systems, especially in the context of caste hierarchies at home. it enables those belonging to oppressed castes to explore better opportunities for work at the destination. when they return home, many of them are able to leverage the skills and capital they have acquired to set up new ventures, such as tea stalls and restaurants.\nreshaping of aspirations\nimproved educational infrastructure and exposure to new technologies is helping rural youth reimagine, and act on, their aspirations. they are increasingly inclined to explore career options beyond their traditional family occupations such as farming or fishing. migration, in this context, serves as a means for them to access different livelihoods and better opportunities outside their home villages.\ndespite this, migration is rarely acknowledged as a livelihood strategy for the poor. it is often overlooked in narratives of job creation and income generation and is still considered to be borne only out of distress and never out of choice. this has resulted in a lack of policy focus on creating infrastructures to enable safe and dignified migration.\nwhat needs to change?\nin a study conducted by gram vikas in 2021, as high as 79.2 percent of the proportion of households in odisha's gajapati district shared that they would not have been able to come out of poverty without the income from the migrant members of the household.\nrecognising migration as a voluntary choice people are making to improve their quality of life is the first and most important step in ensuring safe and dignified migration for all. here are some other aspects that need to be considered.\n1. improving banking infrastructure for families back home\nbased on our work with communities in odisha, we've observed that it's usually men between the ages of 22 and 30 who step outside the district for work. they leave for a majority of the year--anywhere from eight to 11 months. in most cases, these workers come back either during dussehra or during early harvest/spring festivals, or if the family needs labour during sowing and harvest seasons.\nworkers are unable to transfer their remittances back home through bank services because many areas do not have sufficient bank connectivity. presently, they continue to carry cash with them when returning home. despite the fact that their families back home may have functional accounts, banks are few and far between, making it difficult for people to regularly go and collect the money. the lack of banking infrastructure makes it difficult for their families back home to access cash when needed. addressing the scarcity of banks can effectively resolve this. in a positive step, the odisha government has partnered with six public sector banks to provide bank facilities in previously unbanked gram panchayats.\n2. developing better skilling programmes at source districts\nthere has been a growing tendency among boys as young as 16 years old to migrate to the destination areas to earn an income once they look 'adult enough'. this tendency to drop out can be prevented by catering to their needs and providing them with skills that they can leverage to migrate for better livelihood opportunities. however, existing skill development programmes do not suit the requirements of migrant workers from remote rural areas. three types of efforts are needed in this regard:\nmaking vocational skilling centres such as industrial training institutes (itis) more accessible for those with lower education levels, and keeping a focus on developing foundational skills. once this base is set, workers can choose to invest in skill upgradation as and when they feel the need for it.\nstrengthening the recognition of prior learning (rpl), a component of the national skill development system, and making it more accessible to migrant workers. rpl enables the youth to take on industry-relevant skill certifications to help them secure a better livelihood. individuals with prior learning experience or skills can register themselves and get assessed and certified under rpl.\nenabling businesses, especially those in the services sector, to invest in skill development for workers. high turnover rates among lower-level employees in sectors such as facility management, housekeeping, and restaurants pose challenges for small and medium-sized businesses. collaborative efforts involving industry associations and destination state governments can facilitate the skill upgradation of existing workers to address this issue.\n3. creating a portable proof of identity\nidentity is another critical aspect to consider, especially for migrant workers in new locations. aadhaar cards and voter ids often do not suffice because they list their home addresses. this is a huge barrier for workers trying to avail healthcare, public services, and more at the destination, where they need to show proof of residence and work.\nthe one nation one ration card system has not worked effectively in many places. establishing migrant registries at the gram panchayat level and empowering these panchayats to issue identity confirmation letters to migrants could be an important move. these letters would provide a contact number and a reliable reference for a migrant's identity, helping law enforcement identify them when they encounter these individuals.\nin odisha, the biju swasthya kalyan yojana is a positive step as it aims to link hospitals within the system to ensure health insurance coverage for economically disadvantaged communities. currently, private hospitals in kerala are also being linked to the system in order to provide health coverage to migrant workers from odisha.\nin addition to the above steps, certain key measures undertaken at the destination states can also improve the overall environment for migrants:\n1. enabling children's education and care\nmigration by the whole family is not a very prevalent phenomena in odisha. however, instances of whole families migrating are fairly common in bengal and assam. in such cases, children have limited access to schools and anganwadi services in the destination cities. this may be because teachers and anganwadi workers there are not equipped to deal with children from another region in terms of language, cultural sensitivities, and other factors.\nkerala has made some progress in this regard. schools in the state have a high concentration of migrant workers and parent-teacher associations comprise mainly of migrant parents. these schools receive government support to hire para-teachers who can communicate in the local language with the children.\n2. improving living conditions at the destination\nindividuals making the strategic decision to migrate to another place for better livelihood opportunities usually go through their social networks or family members who may already be working at the destination. through these networks, they are able to rent a place, and the amount they are willing to pay in rent depends on the sum of money they want to save and send back home.\nthrough our work we have observed that kerala has better sanitation conditions as compared to places like hyderabad. employer-provided accommodation in construction or factory-based jobs paint a grimmer picture. in surat, where a significant number of odia migrant workers from ganjam district reside, living conditions continue to be poorer than what have been observed in kerala.\nadditionally, a common challenge faced by migrant workers in many destinations is accessing timely medical care. public health systems and clinics often close by the time these workers return from their jobs, leading to difficulties in seeking medical attention. in case of any medical emergency, they risk losing a full day's wage.\nwhile there is a lot more that can be done to ensure safe and dignified migration for all, addressing some of these gaps can help. it's essential to view migration as a critical component of livelihood policies, and as an opportunity for individuals and communities rather than something that needs to be prevented or discouraged. making migration safe, responsible, and dignified has to be a policy priority, and governments, businesses, financial institutions, and civil society organisations have to work together towards this goal.\nthis

      'a recent bloomberg news report that said india and taiwan were in discussions about sending "tens of thousands of workers to the island as early as next month" generated a flurry of concern among social media users in taiwan, resulting in what taiwan\'s ministry of foreign affairs said was a "surge of racist remarks belittling indian workers".\nthe bloomberg report had said taiwan "could hire as many as 100,000 indians to work at factories, farms and hospitals", citing taiwanese officials who had asked not to be identified. the indian and taiwanese governments were expected to sign an employment mobility agreement by december this year.\nlater, taiwanese labor minister hsu ming-chun said the figure of 100,000 workers was "inaccurate", and talks were still going on.\nthe abuse, and the china angle\nadvertisement\nwithin 10 days of the publishing of the report and the surge in racist remarks against indians online, taiwan\'s government said the campaign "bears the hallmarks of #prc cognitive warfare. it\'s a devious move to tarnish our national image & strain #taiwan-#india relations, but the attempt to destroy goodwill in the #milkteaalliance won\'t prevail!" in a post on the social media platform x.\nthe recent surge of racist remarks belittling indian workers bears the hallmarks of #prc cognitive warfare. it\'s a devious move to tarnish our national image & strain #taiwan\ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddfc-#india\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 relations, but the attempt to destroy goodwill in the #milkteaalliance won\'t prevail! pic.twitter.com/8rhbwquxmr -- wai jiao bu ministry of foreign affairs, roc (taiwan) \ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddfc (@mofa_taiwan) november 21, 2023\nin september this year, a draft memorandum of understanding on migration and mobility was finalised between taiwan and india after taipei expressed interest in hiring indian workers across several sectors.\n"the pact that india has signed is a subset of the economic relationship and people to people ties. india is an important source of labour to the middle east, southeast asia etc.," said sana hashmi, a fellow at the taiwan-asia exchange foundation.\nwhy this pact is relevant\nin the context of bilateral relations, the pact is important because it strengthens diplomatic relations between new delhi and taipei, said hashmi. although india and taiwan don\'t have formal diplomatic relations, new delhi and taipei established representative offices in the respective capitals way back in 1995.\nin 2012, taiwan opened the taipei economic and cultural center (tecc) in new delhi, and an office in chennai, with plans to increase its presence in india by opening a third office in mumbai. in the case of india, new delhi has the india-taipei association (ita) office in taipei. these institutions serve as de facto diplomatic missions.\nadvertisement\ntaiwan\'s ageing population has meant that it requires migrant workers in the fields of manufacturing and agriculture. "there is a shortage of labour in taiwan but many blue-collar workers here are from southeast asia. indians will add diversity to the country," hashmi said.\naccording to a bloomberg report from earlier this year, the surging demand for labour is rooted in several factors. "like in many developed economies, taiwan\'s population is rapidly ageing, with the elderly expected to account for more than 20% of the populace by 2025. historically low wages in hospitality have complicated things, discouraging potential workers. the pandemic created more problems as workers retired or left their jobs. the labour force dropped sharply after reaching a record high in august 2019. while the number of people in the labour market has steadily risen in recent months, it still hasn\'t returned to pre-pandemic levels," the report from april said.\nover the past few years, ties between new delhi and taipei have become stronger. the bilateral trade between india and taiwan is on an upswing, where the volume of trade increased from usd 2 billion in 2006 to usd 8.9 billion in 2021, according to a report by the indian express in july this year.\nwhy the racism\nadvertisement\n"taiwan\'s ministry of foreign affairs has already clarified that this is chinese propaganda," said hashmi, referring to the ministry\'s statement. "the concern was that if 1,000 indian workers came to taiwan, how was it going to impact the labour market in taiwan, and how the government would secure the interests of taiwanese blue collar workers. this is a fairly common conversation in many countries whenever a pact like this is signed. the primary concern was that indian workers would take up our jobs," said hashmi.\nthe racist and discriminatory comments on taiwanese social media also focused on safety concerns and what the presence of "thousands" of indian workers, primarily men, would mean for the local population. "the idea among many taiwanese is that india is not safe, after the 2012 delhi gangrape case. it also has to do with how india has been categorised as the most unsafe country in the world by western media."\nin the absence of substantial people to people ties, these misconceptions and negative perceptions have remained, said hashmi, adding that "this is not a majority view". the source of this misinformation campaign are largely pro-china accounts, she explained.\nbut another cause of this recent uproar is also linked to the taiwanese general election scheduled for january 2024, making it a sensitive time for taiwan and its population. misinformation and disinformation campaigns are commonplace in the run-up to crucial polls.',

      'travel a nightmare for migrant workers as indian railways reduces sleeper coaches',
    Article:
      'at 51 years, n c bhatra, a migrant labourer in chennai, finds the 20-hour train journey to his hometown in puri, odisha, arduous and costly. so much so that he has limited his trips home to see his wife and two children to just one or two times a year. bhatra had migrated from puri to chennai in 1996. reserving a ticket in the sleeper coach was much easier then, he says. but over the past five years, he has never been able to book tickets directly as they get sold out much faster.\n"to get a ticket nowadays, i have to book it 1-2 months in advance. but this is impossible as the manager does not confirm leaves so early; leaves could also get cancelled later if another worker is unavailable," he says.\nanother migrant from bihar working in mumbai, 24-year-old santosh kumar also says that sleeper ticket reservation was relatively easier around 2015, when he first came to the city. "at the time, i could get a sleeper ticket two weeks before the travel date, but now this is impossible. i only have the option to travel in general compartments."\nso has the demand for rail travel tickets really shot up? the truth may, at least in part, lie elsewhere.\nlike other inter-state migrant labourers, bhatra and santosh are reeling under the impact of indian railways\' policy of reducing sleeper (sl) coaches over time. for example, the shalimar-chennai coromandel express (passing via bhubaneswar) currently has only five sleeper coaches, but reports of the train\'s accident in 2009 indicate that it had at least 11 sleeper coaches at the time.\nthere is other indicative evidence too. a document compiled by citizen activist balram vishwakarma indicates the reduction in sleeper coaches in various trains over the years.\nscreenshot of a tweet by citizen activist balram vishwakarma. he alleges that indian railways has quietly reduced sleeper class and general coaches for many trains and converted them into 3ac and 2ac coaches to increase revenue.\nunder the circumstances, workers are unable to afford the pricier ac coaches. besides, long-distance trains covering the interstate migrant corridors are few in number, and they usually have only 2-3 general seating (unreserved) compartments which are chronically crowded. "at my age i can\'t travel in the general compartment," says bhatra.\nover the past five years, he has been relying entirely on agents to reserve tatkal tickets, which pushes up costs. "the sleeper ticket usually costs rs 800. but due to the higher price for a tatkal ticket and the agent\'s commission, the cost goes up to rs 1,300-1,350," he says. "i do feel like going home more often, especially during festivals. but my salary as a machine operator is only around rs 19,000 per month, and i can\'t afford the high ticket prices. on one occasion, i even had to book a tatkal ticket in a 3ac coach as the sleeper ticket was unavailable."\nindian railways\' response to an rti application showed that, between 2009 and 2022, out of the total reserved seats, the share of sleeper berths dipped by around 23% in the migrant corridor routes of howrah-bengaluru, howrah-chennai and howrah-hyderabad. the share of sleeper berths declined from 73-79% to 51-56% over this period, as the proportion of ac berths increased.\nan analysis in the hindu showed that, considering only the reserved passenger category between the decade of 2009-10 and 2019-20, the share of passengers carried in ac coaches increased by 9.8%. whereas the share of passengers carried in sleeper and second-sitting reserved compartments declined by 2.8% and 6.6% respectively.\ncommon experiences\nyounger migrants in cities like mumbai and vapi say that sleeper coach tickets would be available only if booked 2-3 months in advance. in addition to the uncertainty about leave sanction etc., these workers in the unorganised sector get their pay settled only a few days before their travel date, making ticket reservations almost impossible.\n"the sleeper ticket usually costs rs 800. but due to the higher price for a tatkal ticket and the agent\'s commission, the cost goes up to rs 1,300-1,350," says n c bhatra of odisha, who works as a machine operator in chennai. pic courtesy: n c bhatra\nahead of chhath puja this november, santosh had bought a general ticket from mumbai to gaya costing around rs 420, but was unable to board the train due to the crowd. "since i could not enter the general compartment, i tried entering a sleeper coach. but there, even people with reserved sleeper tickets were standing near the toilet, unable to get to their seats. many people were standing inside the toilets as well. i felt i might die in the crowd, and decided not to go," he says. he then had to buy another ticket to travel home two days later.\nonly one train goes directly from mumbai through gaya daily, with travel time of around 28 hours. santosh says he usually has to stand throughout the journey. "people are usually sitting on the floor, standing, or even staying put in the toilets."\nfor his return trip to mumbai, he does not board the train from gaya station just 30 minutes away from his home. instead, he travels all the way to koderma junction station in jharkhand to increase his chance of getting a seat. "i leave home by 4 pm, travel by bus and local train to reach koderma station by around 8 pm. then i sleep in the station overnight, and board the train early in the morning," he says.\nchandan kumar, 21, a textile worker in vapi, gujarat, recalled the horror of once having to stand 20 hours straight in a train while having fever. "i was going home to gaya since i was unwell. but the journey worsened my condition and my feet were swollen by the time i reached," he says. like santosh kumar, he too had not been able to board the train home this diwali due to crowds.\nchandan kumar and raju vishwakarma, a mumbai-based worker hailing from prayagraj, up, say they were forced to pay fines for boarding sleeper coaches at times, as they had been unable to board the general compartment. while their general ticket costs rs 300-400, paying fines in the sleeper coach would bring the total to around rs 1,000.\nsalem-based ganesan, a member of the tamil nadu construction workers\' welfare board, says that overcrowding in these trains could even be leading to deaths. recently, upon the requests of organisations supporting migrant labourers, ganesan had traced the bodies of two migrants who had fallen out of a kerala-bound train in salem district.\nthough the exact cause of death is difficult to ascertain in such cases, ganesan says, "the general compartments have capacity of only around 100 each, but around 400 people are often cramped into each coach. we couldn\'t tell where these two workers were going or who their employer was, so their families could not get any compensation."\nin denial\na senior official at indian railways (ir), however, said that the total number of sleeper coaches would not have reduced, as the railways had in fact introduced more trains post-covid.\n"before covid, ir was running 10,186 trains across the country, which has now increased to 10,754. out of this, the mail/express category trains have increased from almost 1,800 to 2,100. railway ministry also plans to introduce 3,000 more trains in the next five years so as to reduce waiting lists. hence the total capacity of trains has increased," he said.\nwhen asked about the declining proportion of sleeper coaches over the years, he said the proportion would have remained the same, but he did not have any data on this.\nto a question on ensuring safe travel for migrant workers, the official said that ir does not consider migrants as a separate category, and is not considering providing separate services for them.\ndemand for safe travel\nafter the coromandel express train mishap this june that claimed 296 lives, most of whom were migrants, several ngos wrote to chief ministers of multiple states on facilitating safe travel for workers. their demands included:\nidentifying migrant hotspots and travel patterns\nintroducing more general compartments in the trains in migrant corridors\nintroducing dedicated weekly trains with general compartments for migrant workers\nproviding booking information in various regional languages to aid migrant workers not proficient in hindi\nproviding subsidised canteen facilities to avoid hunger during travel\ncapturing the names and mobile numbers of people who buy unreserved train tickets, to serve as a database during emergencies\nbut one of the petitioners, who did not want to be identified, says they have received no acknowledgement from the states except a formal response from the kerala cm.\nmost migrant workers are recruited in groups by contractors who are supposed to ensure their travel and accommodation. as per sections 12 to 16 of the inter-state migrant workmen act, 1979, contractors should get workers registered in the source and destination states, and should themselves be registered.\nthey should also give workers a \'displacement allowance\' equal to 50% of their monthly wages at the time of recruitment, and journey allowances that cover the cost of trips to and from home. they should also issue a bookpass to each worker that captures the details of their work and the benefits payable.\nbut as states lack mechanisms to enforce the law, migrants usually bear travel and accommodation expenses themselves. besides, contractors are often no more than workers with a few years of experience, and are incapable of solving systemic problems, ngos say.\nread more: why government schemes aren\'t reaching those who need it the most\nmany travel by buses too\nbesides the shortfall of train seats, another issue is that many source districts don\'t have direct trains connecting them to destination cities. this has led to bus routes evolving along migrant corridors, especially since the 2020 migrant distress, says benoy peter, executive director at the centre for migration and inclusive development.\n"for example, nearly two lakh out of the six lakh migrant workers in kochi are from murshidabad in west bengal. since there are no trains connecting murshidabad to kochi, private buses now regularly ply in this route. a bus ticket in this route costs rs 3,000-3,500," benoy says.\na report, prepared around 2010 by the ngo aajeevika bureau, had found that bus journeys could be perilous too. the report on migrant workers travelling along the relatively short rajasthan-gujarat route had found it was common for workers to sit atop the buses due to crowds, which sometimes led to their deaths from falls or electrocution by electric lines. "the situation still remains the same," says divya verma of aajeevika bureau.\nthe situation in trains pushes many migrant workers to travel long distance by bus, but that is often no cheaper or safer. representational image. pic: bjorn christian torrissen (via flickr)/ cc by-nc 2.0\nthe need of the hour\nngos say that, as a start, indian railways can easily map the migrant corridors, especially smaller source stations (like kantabhanji in odisha) whose ticket sales to cities rocket in certain seasons. then, it should introduce extra coaches or trains along these routes.\nbalram vishwakarma says that ir should also have a system to inform migrant workers early on, regarding special trains that are introduced around holidays like diwali. "they can reach out to, say, workers\' unions or migrants\' associations, so that workers can plan and reserve tickets earlier. currently workers don\'t get this information."\ndivya of aajeevika bureau says that the provisions under the inter-state migrant workmen act can be implemented only through a tripartite arrangement between the worker\'s principal employer, and his source and destination states. the three parties can coordinate regarding fund and resource allocation for workers, and providing them with facilities. "for example, all urban local bodies have a labour officer attached to them. this person can be the nodal officer for registering migrants and for ensuring they have facilities," she says.\nalso read:',
    Summary:
      'Inter-state migrant labourers, bhatra and santosh are reeling under the impact of indian railways\' policy of reducing sleeper (sl) coaches over time. Long-distance trains covering the interstate migrant corridors are few in number, and they usually have only 2-3 general seating (unreserved) compartments which are chronically crowded. "at my age i can\'t travel in the general compartment," says Bhatra. "At my age. I can\'t travel. I don\'t have the option to travel in a general compartment. I have been relying entirely on agents for five years. over the past five years," says bhatrra.',

    Article:
      "in response to a question, the ministry of labour and employment recently informed the lok sabha that as per the national crime records bureau data, daily wage earners constituted the largest proportion, one-fourth, of those who died by suicide in india between 2019 and 2021, as reported in the wire.\nfrom 32,563 in 2019, the number of deaths by suicides by daily wage earners increased to 37,666 in 2020, the year of covid-19 and the national lockdown. the rise in number continued to reach 42,004 in 2021. people, especially daily wage earners and migrants, are thus reeling from the post-covid-19 impact as well.\nmigrants walking during the lockdown was the defining image of the first wave of covid-19.\nmillions of migrants abandoned their temporary residences and belongings, along with their hopes and promises of a better future in an alien place, and started walking for their homes as a lockdown was announced with four hours' notice. some walked hundreds of miles, some even thousands of miles.\nbraving the elements of nature, old, ill, pregnant and able-bodied people walked, along with their children, carrying whatever they could carry with them.\nhundreds of them perished during this journey. those lucky ones who were able to reach their homes alive suffered police batons, and the indignities of travelling like animals, often being fleeced by the transporters.\nalso read: is the e-shram portal really providing benefits to workers or merely creating a national database?\none often hears india is a country of migrants but how many migrants exactly, no one knows, not even the government nor the experts. that they live in precarious conditions without much of a health and social support system was apparently not known to the people in power who announced lockdowns. did they also not know that a significant number of them are daily wage earners and can eat and survive only if they earn every day? migrants' families comprise old people, women and children, some of whom require food, milk and medicines on a regular basis. in most cases, their landlords and employers did not take care of them.\nmigrants' trials at this time was an opportunity for policymakers to learn about migration and migrants and make policies and programmes for their wellbeing. but now it is safe to say that we as a society and country did not learn any lessons. the cut in mgnrega allocation in this year's union budget and the lack of any significant measure for migrant labourers point in the same direction.\nwe missed an opportunity to strengthen our data and information systems to have an accurate picture of the migration scenario in the country and states. census 2011 says there were 450 million internal migrants in india at that time. the economic survey of 2017 says that there are 60 million inter-state migrants, with an average national flow of only 9 million.\nthe national migrant information system, a portal launched to capture the information of migrants travelling on special shramik trains from may 1 to june 3, 2020 and the ministry of railways reported that more than 6 million migrants travelled by trains. another 4 million traveled in buses.\nmigration tables from the census 2011 were released only in 2019, eight years after the census.\nthis paints a sorry state of affairs as far as migration statistics including numbers, demography, migration routes, etc. are concerned. with a rich history of the census (which is now delayed), multitudes of national surveys, the fact that india is a leader in it applications and considering the richness of subject expertise in the country, it needs to do better than this.\nmigrants moving on foot should have been a big wake-up call for all, and appropriate systems should have been put in place for real-time migrant data capturing and sharing for policy development and programme planning.\nthe second lesson to be learned should have been what made these migrants flee the destination cities and places. the status of their health and well-being as well as living and working conditions should have been at the top of the to-do list of the policymakers. appealing to the good side of employers and landlords to take care of migrants, ad-hoc and delayed provision of transportation to reach home with migrants paying from their own pockets, and providing ration and one-time cash transfers are not sustainable and effective policy and programmatic interventions.\nmost migrants work in the informal sector, with no health and social security provisions. their wages are not standardized and secure. lack of affordable housing means they are forced to live in urban villages or slums. the lack of portability of state-specific benefits into another state renders them further vulnerable.\nit is important to mention that migration will gain further momentum in days to come because of differential demographic transitions and unequal economic development and employment opportunities across states.\nas per the population projections by national commission on population, 55%, 17 crores out of the total 31.1 crores population growth in india during 2011-2036, will occur in the five states of bihar, uttar pradesh maharashtra, west bengal and madhya pradesh - all high out-migrating states. the north-central region will have a surplus young working-age population while the greying south will require young hands to keep its institutions running, maintain economic productivity and for taking care of the elderly while. there are already well-established migration routes between these regions. demographic divergence will render further impetus to the migration. kerala, for example, is already witnessing an increased in-migration.\nthe question to ask is: are we proactively planning for such a scenario? the working group on migration (2017) set up by the ministry of urban housing and poverty alleviation examined the status of migrant workers in the country and submitted its report to the government in 2017. action on the report is still awaited.\nmigration could be a big game changer and a win-win situation for individuals, families, states (both sending and receiving) and the nation if collaborative planning is done by migration origin and destination states with the facilitation of the union government.\nthere is a need to gain a deeper understanding of migration flows so that estimations and projections can be made regarding changing need for housing and infrastructure, health care and utilities, education and skills. states need to work together to provide portability of identity proof and entitlements, as well as build support systems for families left behind.\nindia urgently needs to take cognisance of the divergent demographic transition trends. timely strategic action can develop human capacities to cater to future needs and build rights-based policies that work for migrants as well as locals. niti aayog should take the lead in this direction and constitute a high-level task force to develop a white paper outlining current and future situations, policy regimes and mechanisms. the second step, based on the white paper, should be to set up a separate ministry or independent department for migrants with its own mandate, manpower and resources.\ndevender singh worked with the united nations population fund (unfpa) from 2015-2021. currently, he is a visiting senior fellow with the impact and policy research institute (impri), delhi.\ndebasish chowdhury is with medicine sans frontiers (msf).\nedited by soumashree sarkar.",

      "the odisha train crash behoves us to rethink india's labour migration question",
    Article:
      "saakhi is a sunday column from mrinal pande, in which she writes of what she sees and also participates in. that has been her burden to bear ever since she embarked on a life as a journalist, writer, editor, author and as chairperson of prasar bharti. her journey of being a witness-participant continues.\n\"aadmi ko peeth nahin pet hi girata hai\" - 'a man falls not on his back, but on his stomach' - wrote the hindi poet sudama pandey \"dhoomil\". he belonged to the eastern parts of north india, where migration in search of livelihood has been perennial for centuries.\nthe recent three-train collision in odisha has resulted in more than 270 deaths, the majority of whom were heading south from the poverty-stricken east. true, the world has known endemic poverty and migration in search of food since human history began. yet, ever since our economy became globalised, the chasm between the rich and the poor has grown, exacerbating the traditional hostility among the locals towards outsiders who are ready to work at the lowest wages. as they migrate from the hills in manipur, and villages in bihar, eastern uttar pradesh and uttarakhand, millions of economic migrants have repeatedly been condemned and bullied as superfluous outsiders and stealers of local jobs.\nlike the vast covid-19 reverse migrations, the odisha train crash has forced us to rethink the phenomenon of labour migration. according to the last available figures from the decennial census on inter and intra-state migration, 37% of our vast population is on the move. india's migrant workforce constitutes almost 30% of the total population. a 2017 annual economic survey using unreserved railway travel between 2011-16 as a proxy found that the average annual interstate migration figure was almost 9 million, far higher than the figures thrown up by the decennial survey.\nwho are these migrants? they are the ones fuelling growth and keeping our large cities running. as unorganised cheap labour, they fan out in the construction industry as masons, carpenters and painters; they work at construction sites building the new highways; within the city, they are the ones that clean streets, toilets and public spaces. most housing colonies in the metros employ them for handling domestic chores ranging from cooking to babysitting.\nalso read: 'i don't have the option to rent a house': how migrant workers differ from the urban poor\nthe states that send out the largest number of migrants are mostly north of the vindhyas. uttar pradesh tops the list, followed closely by bihar, rajasthan and madhya pradesh.\ngujarat is an exception. gujaratis, when they go out at all, is to travel abroad. locally, most are absorbed within the state. due to being wealthier than the average indian, gujaratis as domestic tourists have a reputation in the travel industry for being vastly privileged.\nfor example, in the newly branded 'holy tourist destination' of uttarakhand, a major part of its own young continue to migrate to the plains, but those in the religious tourism business treat the gujarati paryatak (tourists) with awe. they are mostly big spenders, and the temple priests, hoteliers and coolies who escort them on horseback are very pleased to have them as clients.\nuttarakhand has much less to offer to its own poor. there are thousands of abandoned \"ghost villages\" dotting the religious trails, proof that while tourism may benefit some, it does not address the larger question of generating better jobs and helping farmers contend with increasing encroachments by wildlife.\nwith such variations in financial status, migration for the young in such states has become a better option. but as outsiders come and settle in the state, xenophobic fears among the hindu majority increase.\nto consolidate vote banks, politicians begin talking of the danger migrants pose to fast-dwindling majoritarian locals. a demographic bulimia is evident today in parts of uttarakhand, where panchayats have said that muslim shops must be ostracised and mosques razed for being 'illegal constructions'.\nsimilar bad-mouthing and attacks have been seen in maharashtra, delhi, gujarat and the south against the sattu and khaini eaters from the north, even though the amount of money repatriated by immigrants to support their families back home is not large enough to bail them permanently out of poverty.\nthe new migrations have some new features too. with levels of education and skills rising among small-town, middle-class young graduates, the new, upwardly mobile bhaiya entrepreneur is visible on the horizon in it hubs. these young people are smart and keen to use their skills in greener pastures abroad whenever they get a chance. but they are not as unwelcome as those that are once again ready to travel in the coromandel express five days after the mega-mishap.\nour trains, ever since one can recall, have been under stress from budgetary cuts and the increase in the sheer numbers of people travelling in unreserved compartments. these millions, hanging on to door handles or perched on rooftops, are risking their lives to flee certain death by starvation. covid reverse migrations, where many migrants who did not have money to buy tickets chose to travel on foot or by cycle, ended up dying like flies from heat, starvation or covid have underscored that beyond doubt.\nas life limps back to normal post-covid, trains like bihar sampark kranti express and the coromandel express are once again the lifeline to penniless passengers. few would recall that up until the 1970s and 1980s, the coromandel express was known as the hospital express because it carried the sick (sufficiently well-to-do ones) to better hospitals in the south.\nalso read: a 'migrant train', the coromandel express had been the ticket to a livelihood for bengal's poorest\nthe economy today requires cheap labour on a larger scale still. the new migrations are easier because mobility has increased enormously within the country, with many more trains and new highways. the high-income, low-population growth states south of the vindhyas are at an advantage here. they were already well armed with high literacy rates, relatively less crowded (and therefore safer) cities, and smoother administrations that did not impede investment. the good thing also was that the southern political satraps, like the southern filmmakers, opted for a free flow of capital and drew talent behind them without regard to caste, language or religion.\nby the time the modi government came to power, the south was already very well-networked in the high-growth global markets, especially in the it and pharma sectors. today these rich states, with their firmly-entrenched regional satraps, will mostly disregard the patriotic and casteist political jumlas coming from the north. but as the recent karnataka assembly elections showed, they are quick learners and can and will make tactical use of caste and religion if need be.\nour moral philosophers pontificating in tv panels on the possible causes of the odisha mishap have remained mostly unaware of the non-political dimensions of the tragedy, perhaps because they were safely seated upon terra firma. but the parable of the coromandel express poses harsh questions for india as a democracy.\ndoes the great migration represent a solution? if yes, to which problem? the problem of environmental degradation? lack of local jobs other than serving tourists? the problem of abandoned fields and ageing parents? the problem of increasing human-wildlife collisions? would a state like uttarakhand be helped if the active half of its population and two-thirds of its young families left their endangered, unproductive fields and homes in ancestral villages and became settlers in the plains?\nthere can be no simple answer to these questions.\nmrinal pande is a writer and veteran

    Title:
      "instead of fake news about attacks, let's talk about the real issues facing migrant workers",
    Article:
      "the past few days have been marked by fact-checkers exposing a lot of fake audio-visual content virally circulating on social media pertaining to alleged attacks against migrant workers in tamil nadu.\nthe timing of the videos coincided with the 70th birthday celebration of chief minister m.k. stalin, an event that saw participation of prominent opposition leaders including tejashwi yadav, the deputy chief minister of bihar. the event had allusions to electorally effective unity among opposition parties in the run up to the 2024 general elections.\nsubsequently, the leader of opposition in the bihar legislative assembly, vijay kumar sinha of the bharatiya janata party, made claims about the purported violence against migrant workers in tamil nadu. despite the videos being fake, it was reported that these effectuated a panic exodus of migrant workers from tamil nadu, though the chief minister's office tried to assuage fears through an official statement. however, it is also observed that holi is the reason for this bout of seasonal out-migration from the state.\nthe rumours driving the narrative of migrant exodus are not just due to the stir created from outside. there has been an ostensible undercurrent of animosity against the hindi-speaking migrant workers predominantly propagated by seeman, the chief coordinator of the naam tamilar katchi (ntk, or we tamils party) and his virulent tamil nativist followers. the fear-mongering vis-a-vis the migrant labourers was furthered by a widely popular video posted on january 6, that reeked of humiliation of the migrant workers and their habits. it was posted in the backdrop of tamil nadu-bound train passengers' complaints against migrant workers sitting in passage areas within the train. the video garnered over nine million views, and was both endorsed by the ntk and became a viral meme template on social media.\nfurther, anti-migrant labour sentiment became the theme of a widely watched television comedy show which aired on february 19, with seeman as the special guest. while both the video and the television show can assert their creative freedom and their right to express, in effect the sentiment had been disseminated. however, flash surveys reveal that the migrant workers were not subject to any discriminatory treatment and were happy working in the state. such responses challenge the veracity of the claims made by the bjp leadership in bihar.\ntaking refuge in reality\nby now it is sufficiently known that in the last two decades there has been a steadily growing inflow of migrant population into the southern states, mainly from the states of uttar pradesh and bihar. the economic survey 2016-17 provided fresh evidence on internal work-related migration in its attempt to estimate the size of and trends in inter-state migration in the country. analysing the census data of 1991, 2001 and 2011, it discerned that \"internal migration rates have dipped in maharashtra and surged in tamil nadu and kerala, reflecting the growing pull of southern states in india's migration dynamics (emphasis added).\" furthermore, mapping work-related migratory routes and patterns based on railway passenger traffic data for the period 2011-2016, it showed that tamil nadu experienced \"major net in-migration\" to the tune of three million.\nalso read: was fake news about 'attacks' on migrant labourers an attempt to malign tamil nadu?\nmore recent estimates of the inter-state migrant worker population in tamil nadu are hard to come by. however, statements by owners of industrial units in the state's manufacturing hubs clustered in the northern and western belts provide us valuable anecdotal evidence of the contribution of the hindi-speaking migrant workers to tamil nadu's economy. from their statements, we can also glean that the hundreds of thousands of these migrant workers are concentrated in low-paying jobs without any social safety nets in the manufacturing and service sectors. given tamil nadu's high gross enrolment ratio in higher education, with important caveats, it is natural for those with higher educational qualifications to progressively seek and secure high-paying employment opportunities. taken together with the capitalist preference for 'cheap' labour as a cost-cutting strategy, the aforementioned trends are only indicative of the challenges that accompany an economy undergoing structural transformation.\nmost importantly, assembling the findings of various studies undertaken by researchers, the economic survey makes it very clear that work-related internal migration in india is 'circular' and 'semi-permanent' in nature. it means that migrant workers leaving their villages and towns in search of employment elsewhere do not permanently settle down in destinations where they find work. instead, they are constantly on the move, in a precariously footloose fashion, eventually returning to their homes. moreover, a very large proportion of this footloose migration is seasonal, a phenomenon that india's official data collection agencies are not equipped to capture in its entirety.\nit is important to emphasise these dimensions of inter-state migration in india in order to responsibly counter the divisive rhetoric of political formations with a pronounced nativist orientation. their fear-mongering about migrant workers from the northern states becoming politically dominant in tamil nadu over time and driving out the tamil people after rendering them economically destitute, is completely baseless and unwarranted. the astute thol. thirumavalan, party leader of the viduthalai chiruthaigal katchi and member of parliament, articulated in an interview that cutting across linguistic and regional divides, the migrant workers must be viewed as part of the larger democratic working class, struggling for dignity and justice.\nmaking sense of the present through history\nin order to make sure that such potentially dangerous narratives do not gain any more traction, it is important to mobilise the historical resources at our disposal, in addition to presenting solid empirical evidence and logically sound arguments.\nin the 1930s, as the economic repercussions of the great depression were beginning to be felt in the southeast asian countries exporting agricultural commodities, public anger caused by economic hardship was directed at the 'outsiders' and demanded their repatriation. the tamil migrants formed a substantial segment of this working class population identified and targeted as outsiders in sri lanka, burma and present-day malaysia and singapore. in fact, as the economist and author chinmay tumbe writes in india moving, \"by 1930, tamils represented around half of all overseas indians as these three regions hosted nearly 70 per cent of all overseas indians.\"\nalso read: dividing north and south india with lies is anti-national and bjp must be criticised for it\nhaving been at the receiving end of verbal and physical attacks in an overseas territory at a crucial juncture in history, tamil society is certainly well-placed to understand the plight of poor migrant workers seeking a modicum of economic security and to ensure their safety in the state.\nin light of this episode involving rumours about the safety of hindi-speaking migrant workers in tamil nadu, some political leaders have expressed the view that the animosity harboured by the tamil people towards those coming from the northern states is an outcome of the anti-north sentiment cultivated by the dravidian movement for many decades now. statements of a few prominent leaders of the dravida munnetra kazhagam have seemingly given currency to the aforesaid view. it is worth pointing out that c.n. annadurai, founder of the dmk, had expressed agony at the economic dominance of the commercial life in madras by the capital-owning mercantile elite from north india. no antipathy was harboured against the working class of that region. on closer look, annadurai's 1949 pamphlet panathottam (the garden of money) was a call for the democratisation of capital, the ownership of which was regionally skewed.\nthis must serve as a compelling reminder for the present-day political class, including those in the dmk, to bring under scrutiny the capital accumulation strategies of the economic elite that come at the expense of the welfare of labour. notably, due to the structural pressures of the prevalent neoliberal framework, successive governments' in tamil nadu have responded by establishing welfare boards that provide social security for unorganised workers. if anything, the anti-north discourse was one that criticised the centralising tendencies of the union government and the frequent attempts at hindi imposition. it was driven by a quest for regional autonomy in policy and administrative matters.\nin conclusion, the discussions on internal work-related migration in india can take a more constructive turn if there is sustained focus on redressing regional economic imbalances and on ensuring just work conditions, dignity and social security for migrant workers. while the 'reverse migration' during nationwide lockdowns in 2020 did not spur concrete policy actions on these fronts, now is an opportune moment.\nraghunath nageswaran is a doctoral researcher at the geneva graduate institute. vignesh karthik k.r. is a doctoral researcher at king's india institute, king's college london. the authors

      'mamata banerjee government to launch massive outreach programmes to get more migrant labourers from bengal',
    Article:
      'the mamata banerjee government has decided to launch massive outreach programmes in states like kerala, maharastra, tamil nadu, gujarat and karnataka to get more migrant labourers from bengal registered on the karmasathi portal, which was launched as part of an initiative to offer a better deal to people leaving bengal in search of livelihood.\nthe attempt to reach out to the migrant workers, a source said, was initiated after the nabanna top brass found that only about 34 per cent of the estimated migrant labourers had registered their names on the portal through the recent duare sarkar camps.\nadvertisement\nsources in nabanna said the chief minister\'s office had a record of 40,00,858 migrant labourers who had returned to bengal during the nationwide lockdown in the wake of the covid-19 outbreak in 2020.\na majority of the workers were brought back by the state and the rest had returned on their own.\n"but the names of only 13.60 lakh migrant labourers were registered on the karmasathi portal through the duare sarkar camps held between september 1 and 30. so, it\nhas been decided that outreach programmes will be held in the states with most of the migratory labourers. the details of the programmes will be finalised soon," said a senior bengal government official.\naccording to the records, 9,03,611 workers were brought back from kerala during the lockdown, but only 2,26,763 people employed in the southern state have registered their names on the portal. similarly, only 2,24,607 workers in maharashtra have recorded their details on the portal though 7,17,594 labourers had been ferried back to bengal from the western state during the pandemic.\nthe picture is not much different in the case of tamil nadu, gujarat and karnataka. only 1,40,085 migrant labourers in tamil nadu have registered their names though the number of returnees from tn in 2020 had been 6,12,477.\nthe number of migrant workers who returned to bengal during the lockdown from gujarat and karnataka was 4,69,069 and 2,74,568, respectively.\nhowever, the registered migrant labourers in gujarat and karnataka are just 59,218 and 96,082, respectively.\na source said the government was toying with the idea of setting up help desks in the states with migrant workers to get them registered with the portal.\n"the total figure of current migrant workers might increase or decrease now since the state initiated some measures to give the migrants jobs in bengal. at the same time, some people went out of the state in search of livelihood. whatever the situation is, it is clear that many of the migrants did not register their names on the portal," said a bureaucrat.\nthe mamata banerjee dispensation also has a plan to arrange for jobs for the migrant labourers in bengal after they registered their names. the government is trying to get in touch with several companies in bengal with a plea to employ labourers from within the state. the karmasathi portal will have details of the workers available and the companies can choose the required hands from among them.\n"the success of such an effort depends on the registration of the migrant labourers on the karmasathi portal and that\'s why outreach campaigns are charted to record the names of all the migrants," said a source.\nthe government had taken the initiative to get the migrant workers registered with the karmasathi portal in a bid to provide them with jobs in the state and also initiate a skill development programme for them so that they can earn more.\nbut it was found that migrant labourers working in states like kerala, maharastra, tamil nadu, gujarat and karnataka have shown little interest in registering themselves in the portal.\nreaching out to the migrant workers is very important for the ruling establishment in bengal ahead of the 2024 lok sabha polls as this lot can change the electoral fate of the political parties in districts like north and south dinajpur, malda, murshidabad, birbhum, north and south 24 parganas.\nthe ruling establishment, sources said, has aimed to reach out the migrant labourers as it felt that the bjp had put up a better show in the north bengal districts from where most of the migrant workers go to other states only because the ruling party did not get their support.\n"the situation this time is also not in favour of the ruling party. the government had tried to give them jobs under the 100 days\' job scheme after they returned to the state during the pandemic. but soon after the lockdown was eased, they went back to their workplaces. this makes it clear they did not get enough opportunity in the state. this remains as an achilles heel for the ruling party," said a source.',
    Summary:
      'Only 34 per cent of migrant labourers registered on karmasathi portal through duare sarkar camps. Mamata banerjee government launched outreach programmes in states like kerala, maharastra, tamil nadu, gujarat and karnataka. Only 1,40,085 migrant labourer in tamilNadu have registered their names on the portal. Only 2,24,607 workers in mahar Maharashtra have recorded their names.

    Article:
      'new delhi: the world development report has estimated a 120% income gain for indians going to work overseas, compared to a 40% rise in case of internal migration.the report, released on tuesday, has estimated that low-skilled indians migrating to the us stand to gain the most as they would see a jump in income of nearly 500%, followed by uae at almost 300%.those migrating to the gulf cooperation council ( gcc ) nations, comprising saudi arabia, bahrain, oman, qatar, kuwait and uae, stand to gain lesswhile the gains are much higher for highly skilled workers, like tech workers migrating to silicon valley or doctors, even low-skilled workers experience multi-fold jumps. apart from the skills, the gain also depends on age, destination and language ability."migration leads to large wage increases for most people whose skills and attributes are a strong match with the needs of the destination society. these gains often exceed what could be achieved in the country of origin, even from internal migration to relatively better-off locations. the gains are so large that at current rates of economic growth it would take decades for the average low-skilled person working in some countries of origin to earn the income they achieve by migrating to a high-income country. these gains are then shared with families and communities in the countries of origin through remittances," said the world development report 2023.but migration also comes at a cost, although smaller. for instance, an indian worker going to qatar spends two months\' earnings to meet migration cost. it\'s a little more for those going to kuwait. at almost nine months, it is much higher for a bangladeshi migrating to kuwait.the report estimated the number of migrants globally at 184 million, which is 2.3% of the population, including 37 million refugees. it said there are four types of migrants --economic migrants with strong skill match (indian it professionals in the us or construction workers in gcc nations), refugees with skills in demand at destination (syrian entrepreneur refugees in turkiye), distressed migrants (some poorly skilled migrants at the us southern border) and refugees (rohingya in bangladesh).india-us, india-gcc and bangladesh-india have been identified to be among the top migration corridors globally along with mexico-us, china-us, philippines-us and kazakhstan-russia.the wdr noted how remittances have increased to some of the countries with a large migrant population, including india, mexico, china and the philippines. it estimated that an indian migrant worker in the uae, for instance, sends nearly 70% of his/her income to the family, with women likely to remit a higher amount.the migration of indian workers from certain parts of the country has also resulted in internal migration, the report said, pointing to how emigration from kerala has resulted in relocation opportunities for workers from kolkata.the report said that aging and lower fertility rates in countries was resulting in migration, which, if managed properly "provides benefits for all people -- in origin and destination societies".',

      "worry for tamil nadu manufacturers: 'waiting to see how many migrant workers return after holi'",
    Article:
      'manufacturers and industry leaders are worried about a potential exodus of north indian labourers from tamil nadu -- home to nearly 10 lakh migrant workers as per government data -- over viral videos purportedly showing hindi-speaking men being assaulted in the state.\n"the entire industrial and manufacturing sector in tamil nadu will come to a halt if these rumours [of attacks on north indian workers] continue to escalate. without the workforce from north india, we cannot not operate in tamil nadu. we are waiting to see how many of these workers return after holi," said jaya vijayan, secretary of the chennai district small scale industries association.\nof the 10 lakh migrant workers in tamil nadu, about half are concentrated in northern tamil nadu cities of thiruvallur, chennai and chengalpattu, while the remaining are primarily based in the manufacturing hubs of tirupur, coimbatore and erode.\nadvertisement\ntrouble in the state started when two videos allegedly showing migrant workers being beaten up in tamil nadu went viral recently on social media and whatsapp groups. the sense of panic and fear among the hindi-speaking community prompted even tamil nadu chief minister m k stalin, his bihar counterpart nitish kumar and his jharkhand counterpart hemant soren to take note of the developments. the videos have since then been dismissed by the state police as "false" and "mischievous".\naccording to s surulivel, president of the railway suppliers\' association and owner of businesses in state industries promotion corporation of tamilnadu ltd (sipcot), nearly 2,000 workers have left the state over the last three days from the units he is familiar with. over 20,000 north indian workers are employed in more than 300 units at sipcot in coimbatore alone.\ndespite efforts by state agencies to quell the unrest, including governor r n ravi urging north indian labourers in tamil nadu on sunday not to panic or feel insecure as the people of tamil nadu are very nice and the state government is committed to provide them security, manufacturers and business owners rued that the damage has already been done.\na well-known construction engineer in chennai said workers who had left for their homes a week ago to celebrate holi and those who had left over the last three days were terrified because of reports of attacks and killings. "we found it difficult to dispel these rumours because the majority of the news articles in their phones were in hindi. many of them still want to leave but we are trying to reassure them by promising to provide them with vehicles so they don\'t have to use public transport and also offering to provide them food at the site itself," he said.\nadvertisement\nhe added that many who have already left tamil nadu are refusing to return after holi.\n"our labour contractors are calling them repeatedly to make sure they come back after holi. there is no distinction on the ground, even if the rumours, which originated from north indian politicians, targeted workers from bihar. when it comes to labourers, they are all north indian workers. additionally, there are reports of attacks on hindi-speaking people in some news articles and tweets. employees from all hindi-speaking states are experiencing panic. they keep sending us videos and news articles, but we are unable to address every rumour," he said.\nthe rumours have stirred enough trouble that many workers are feeling pressured by their families to leave tamil nadu immediately. even as labourers staying at various construction sites and the guindy industrial estate in chennai claimed their employers had assured their safety, they remain uneasy as numerous news articles and videos in hindi about the alleged attacks in tamil nadu continue to flood their phones.\nadvertisement\namarinder kumar, 26, a construction worker at an apartment site close to velachery, "we feel helpless when our mothers and wives back home feel afraid because of reports of attacks. we know now that everything is fine. some security guards and a labour contractor met us at the site twice. they also showed us videos to prove that every hindi news report on our phones was false but we won\'t know till after holi how many workers will come back to work here."\nsri ram, 20, who works at a major construction site near guindy, said many people from nearby units have already left for bihar. "no one from my construction site left because lodging and food are provided at the site itself. those who have to take a bus to get to work are anxious due to reports coming out of bihar," he said.\nsashikanth, 35, who works at a manufacturing facility in guindy industrial estate, said not just bihar residents but all north indian workers and their families were feeling alarmed due to the political statements being made in their home states. "the police came here on saturday and assured our safety. they bought us tea and biscuits. they said we could visit them whenever we wanted and gave us phone numbers to call if there were problems," he said.\nand although tamil nadu doesn\'t offer any special perks, at least five migrant workers told the indian express that they had moved to the state due to higher pay and respect. "in chennai, we are paid rs 400 to rs 600 for a day\'s work, compared to rs 75 to rs 100 in bihar. we are also treated with some respect by the employers here. they are not cruel or intimidating like our employers back home," said a former worker from bihar who is a labour contractor across the city\'s numerous construction sites.\nas the situation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen what would help restore confidence and prevent further unrest.',

    Article:
      "in recent years, indian railways has been in the news for claiming to be undergoing a rapid transformation towards catering to the modern-day needs of the passengers. the government has glaringly advertised the newly inaugurated class of trains under the name of vande bharat, the much-discussed bullet train, and the resolution to overhaul railway stations to resemble airports, etc. these attention-grabbing announcements have been depicted as momentous changes taking place in the history of independent india.\nhowever, the train collision in balasore district, odisha, remembered as the worst railway mishap in recent decades, has called into question multiple issues that the railway organisation and the indian government have sidelined. this article discusses the railways' critical role in long-distance interstate migration and how the recent policy priorities with respect to coach composition dehumanise migrant poor people.\nunequal development, mass migration, and the railways\nsince the onset of neoliberal reforms in the indian economy, india's growth story has also involved unequal development. while a few pockets of india, primarily concentrated in the south and west of the country, have seen high growth rates with rapid urbanisation and the emergence of megacities, other areas of the country have either experienced lower growth rates or are mired in distress.\nin light of low agricultural incomes and lack of opportunities to improve incomes in rural areas, rural indians have been moving distances in search of new opportunities and better lives. as many studies have shown, most of them choose intrastate migration, where they migrate within their states, because of the closer distance from home and familiarity with the habitat.\nhowever, the concentration of growth in only a few corners of the country has stimulated migration from distressed areas of the east and north-eastern regions to megacities and urban areas in the south and the west. moreover, while it is challenging to provide exact figures, many studies corroborate that mass migration is disproportionately constituted by people from poor and marginalised sections seeking employment in low-paying sectors such as construction, industrial labour and informal labour.\nindian railways acts as a pivotal thread connecting the regions of unequal development, facilitating the movement of goods and people between them. because of connectivity and affordability, long-distance migrants prefer to travel by train. specifically, the poor and the marginalised seeking employment in the low-wage sector rely on the sleeper class and the unreserved coaches.\nchanging class priorities of the railways\ntill recently, sleeper and unreserved coaches constituted the majority of passenger coaches. because these non-air-conditioned are affordable, travelling in those coaches has been the priority for passengers with low incomes. nevertheless, the prevalence of these coaches is changing now. along with introducing modern link hofmann busch (lhb) coaches to replace dilapidated old swiss integrated coach factory (icf) coaches in the existing trains, coach composition too is being overhauled with more ac coaches and fewer sleeper coaches.",

The train collision in balasore district, odisha, remembered as the worst railway mishap in recent decades, has called into question multiple issues that the railway organisation and the indian government have sidelined.

      'telangana assembly polls: migrant workers unite to put up political fight for pending demands',
    Article:
      "as political parties gear up for the telangana assembly elections on november 30, the state's migrant workers residing in over 20 foreign countries have resolved to enter the poll fray and put up a strong fight to highlight their demands and neglect from the state and central governments.\ndeclaring themselves as a vote bank of over 1 crore votes in a state with just over 3 crore voters, they have not only identified six assembly constituencies in northern telangana to fight elections but also decided to have family members and widows of gulf victims enter the fray by filing over a 100 nominations in kamareddy assembly constituency, one of the two seats chosen by chief minister k chandrashekar rao to contest this time. the six constituencies are vemulawada, korutla, jagityal, balkonda, nirmal, and sircilla.\nto this effect, a 'dubai-declaration' was passed by representatives of more than 24 migrants' rights and welfare unions that gathered in dubai last week. as a strategy to also draw national attention, this was tried out earlier in the nizamabad lok sabha polls of 2019 where turmeric farmers, upset over the non-establishment of the turmeric board, filed over 200 nominations in the run-up to the polls that saw then mp kalvakuntla kavitha, the chief minister's daughter, lose the contest to bjp's aravind dharmapuri. earlier in 1996, nalgonda lok sabha constituency had seen a record 480 nominations as a protest from its fluoride-affected villagers.\nadvertisement\naccording to government estimates, there are approximately 15 lakh telangana workers in the gulf as well as south asian countries, in addition to another 25 lakh workers who have returned home over the years.\non october 14 and 15, more than 25 organisations based in telangana and various gulf countries convened in dubai and interacted with gulf migrants over the week. guggilla ravi goud, convenor of the telangana gulf workers joint action committee, an umbrella organisation of 24 unions, told indianexpress.com that their demands have been neglected for too long by governments at the centre and the state.\ngoud, who has decided to contest the polls from the vemulawada assembly constituency, said political parties and governments have done nothing more than offer lip service. he says the state government's promises to spend an annual budget of rs 500 crore for gulf workers, establish a telangana gulf workers welfare board, and develop a state nri policy have remained promises to date. \"nearly 2,000 telangana people have died in gulf countries in the last 10 years. there is no ex-gratia. a large number of people are languishing in jails abroad for technical mistakes and our governments do not offer legal or financial assistance. it is terrible that their names are being removed from the ration cards back home due to their non-availability to fulfil kyc needs. though we are the biggest remitters of foreign money, we do not have schemes for gulf workers' families welfare,\" he said.\nadding to this, mandha bheem reddy, president of emigrants welfare forum, said that since their names are being removed from ration cards, they are unable to avail arogyasri health scheme or other social security benefits such as dalit bandhu or bc bandu schemes.\nadvertisement\n\"these are poor workers who left their families behind to earn a livelihood in a foreign land. during covid-19 repatriation, the government of india charged double the flight charges from them. unlike other state governments like maharashtra, kerala and andhra pradesh who offered free quarantine facilities, the telangana government collected money from these poor people,\" reddy underlined.\naccording to swadesh parkipandla, president of pravasi mitra labour union, the single point agenda of the meeting convened in dubai was to discuss the state and centre's non-serious attitude towards the welfare of migrant workers and hence the need to take the political plunge. \"we have the candidates already. we have met with migrant workers in the gulf and held late-night meetings with them at labour camps over the week. while they would not go back to cast their votes, they would influence and convince their families and friends back home. we will use voice calls, video calls, and social media and whatever we can to put our message across,\" parkipandla said.\none of the grouses the workers have against the centre is regarding the pravasi bharatiya bima yojana (pmby) which offers rs 10 lakh insurance cover towards accidental death or permanent disability leading to loss of employment. \"we have been demanding the government to include even natural deaths in this and the insurance should be available to all migrants irrespective of their passport status - ecr (emigration check required) or ecnr (emigration check not required ). we are ready to pay an increased premium and yet the government does not want to be the facilitator,\" added reddy.\nadvertisement\nalso read | telangana assembly elections: full list of congress candidates for the 2023 state polls\nalong with telangana workers from 18 ecr countries such as saudi arabia, kuwait, oman, yemen, uae, malaysia etc, workers associations in countries such as singapore have joined the cause. earlier, during the huzurabad byelections of 2021, a similar plan to field a candidate was floated to put pressure on the government but not put into effect.\nwhile congress mp rahul gandhi is scheduled to meet with families of gulf migrants in telangana on friday as part of his three-day visit to the state, the leaders say it will not affect their decision to contest the polls.",

    Title: 'migrant workers paid a huge price for covid-19',
    Article:
      "the mass movement of migrant workers during the pandemic allowed india's authorities to weaken labour rights.\nby manish k jha, tata institute of social sciences\nnew delhi, june 23 - when covid-19 took hold in india, millions of migrant workers fled the cities back to their villages to wait out the lockdown.\nas they waited at home -- sometimes for months -- there was a seismic shift in their relationship with the government and their employers.\non the pretext of responding to the emergency, central and state governments introduced several labour policies that impacted workers adversely.\nat every stage -- migration, lockdown, and return -- labour control was consolidated through exceptional rules and guidelines without any debate or scrutiny.\nwhen the government had to respond to the migrants' desperate exit from the cities, its response came in the form of an advisory to employers not to terminate their workers' contracts and ensure the payment of full wages.\nthe advisory was non-binding and therefore destined to fail. instead, there were large-scale job losses, layoffs and non-payment of wages or wage cuts.\nhowever, after realising the extent of economic damage that labour shortages could entail, employers and the government tried to prevent the migrant workers from leaving.\nhuge numbers of informal sector workers (construction, domestic work, home-based work, handloom and power loom sector, beedi making and brick kilns) were pushed into an even more insecure, unsafe, and unprotected sector, subject to non-formal and non-standard employment practices.\nthe indian government seized the opportunity provided by the pandemic and proposed drastic changes in labour laws by combining 44 central labour laws and around 200 state-level laws into four labour codes.\nalthough the indian parliament had already passed the code on wages before the pandemic; the remaining three -- the industrial relations code, 2020; the occupational safety, health and working conditions code, 2020; and the code on social security, 2020 -- were hurriedly passed by parliament during the lockdown.\nalthough these codes compromised workers' rights and increased the uncertainty of employment conditions, they were justified on the ground that the previous labour laws were tedious, costly to implement and resulted in employers adopting strategies to circumvent them.\nstate governments seized the opportunity as well and changed their labour laws either by amending their provisions or suspending some others. they in effect transferred risks from the employers to the workers.\nthis allowed industries in rajasthan, gujarat, himachal pradesh and uttar pradesh to increase the working day from eight hours to 12 hours for six days a week, in violation of international labour organization (ilo) convention on the hours of work, to which india is a signatory.\nin gujarat and uttar pradesh, the industries were not even required to pay overtime to workers.\nthese states scrapped the industrial employment (standing orders) act, 1946 which requires employing firms to define and submit to the certifying officer the terms and conditions of employment. except for haryana, all the other states announced that these changes would be in force temporarily.\ngujarat announced that except for laws about the payment of minimum wages, safety norms and compensation for workers for industrial accidents, no other provisions of the labour law would apply to new companies that wished to operate in the state for at least 1,200 days, as well as for those that had already been operational for that period.\nthis regime of labour control was deeply embedded in official policies during the pandemic. the term \"labour-control regime\" refers to the social need of the market economy to integrate labour into the production system and structure the labour process.\nexercising control is easier when the labour market has migrants and casual workers, production takes place outside the organised sector, trade unions are weak or absent, work schedules are flexible and subcontracting is prevalent.\nshock mobility ensures a ready supply of labour which is both insecure and vulnerable, willing to accept lower wages, work harder and longer, and with little or no claim on social security, labour rights and entitlements.\nthe opportunity provided by the pandemic-induced shock mobility was used to push through a neoliberal economic agenda, which sees the government's specific function as producing a conducive environment for the operation of the free market and then retreat.\nduring the pandemic, 'ease of doing business' was presented as the rationale for contracting out work and increasing labour market flexibility by changing labour laws and mandatory government oversight. such policies tend to exacerbate inequality during disasters or crises.\nthe fact the shock situation was deployed for maximising the interests of business and compromising the work and social security of migrant labour has been a telling reality of the neoliberal political economy in operation.\nthe pandemic was also used for the expansion of the platform and gig economy, which swiftly made inroads into everyday life. this sector works on replacing one set of migrant workers with another to keep the wages low, making the worker easily replaceable and providing minimal labour protection.\nthe pandemic put vulnerable migrants at greater risk of life and livelihood while india's various governments responded with impunity, compromising the dignity of the workers and controlling their mobility.\ngovernment defended the demands of corporations leading to the expulsion of marginal workers and their subsequent incorporation into an emerging political economy under more severe conditions of precarity.\nas the pandemic showed, an infusion of shock in society only made worse the vulnerabilities of migrant workers.\nmanish k jha is a professor at the school of social work at tata institute of social sciences, mumbai.\narticle courtesy of 360info.",

    Title: 'eastern europe turns to workers from india, pakistan to fill jobs',
    Article:
      'the neat two-story rows of white containers stretch right up to the towering cranes of the vast construction site. clothes can be seen hanging in some of the windows. the compound will eventually be home to as many as 5,200 workers, most of them coming from asia. the indians, pakistanis, filipinos and turkmen are being employed by orlen sa, poland\'s largest company and the government\'s economic champion, to build a new $6.3 billion plastics facility at its sprawling refining complex.\nabout 600 kilometers (370 miles) south in hungary, chinese builders are milling around on a break, checking their mobile phones. they are helping construct one of three plants near the city of debrecen, part of prime minister viktor orban\'s vision for electric vehicle battery manufacturing to underpin the future hungarian economy. the notion of foreign workers filling gaps in the labor market is hardly unusual, and a chronic shortage is forcing employers across europe to look further afield. but in these parts of eastern europe, that\'s unmasked an awkward truth: economic reality has caught up with some of the most vitriolic anti-immigrant rhetoric on the continent.\nalso read colgate to give teeth to non-oral care business\npoliticians in warsaw and budapest have long railed against european union plans for migrant quotas. faced with hundreds of thousands of unfilled positions in a labor market that threatens to put a brake on growth, officials now argue thousands of arrivals from asia are "guest workers" rather than migrants who will stay. the change in the narrative is making them a target for political foes. poland\'s governing law & justice party, which is seeking a third straight term in what\'s set to be a tight election on oct. 15, last month abandoned a plan to fast-track visas after criticism from the main opposition party. in hungary, orban is being blamed for replacing locals with cheaper asian workers.\n"of course there\'s a shift," laszlo papp, the mayor of debrecen, said in an interview at his office last week. "but there\'s a huge difference between the migration that we opposed and the issue of foreign workers, and the difference is control," said papp, a member of orban\'s ruling fidesz party. "that makes it acceptable." ever since the refugee crisis of 2015 and germany\'s decision to open its border, the populist leaderships in poland and hungary have cast themselves as the protectors of europe\'s christian heritage.\norban\'s government notoriously built a fence to keep out refugees, illegally refused to process asylum seekers and put up billboards warning foreigners against taking away jobs in hungary. polish ruling party leader jaroslaw kaczynski said muslims were a threat to europe. most recently, in july, the two countries sought to block an eu plan for member states to share the accommodation of arrivals from outside europe. it\'s a nativism that\'s served them well at the ballot box in some of the least multicultural parts of europe. but most eastern economies in the eu have jobless rates of 5% or lower, and at least 670,000 jobs remain unfilled across the region.\nthat\'s prompting governments to act in the face of aging population and find millions of people to keep their economies running in the years to come. the shortage became more acute after russia\'s invasion of ukraine upended the flow of workers across the border that many neighboring countries relied on.\nin hungary, orban told corporate executives earlier this year that the struggling economy will need 500,000 new workers within two years if the country is to come good on investments in new battery plants worth about $15 billion. that\'s equivalent to more than 10% of its current workforce. parliament passed a law making it easier to bring in foreign workers while capping their stay at three years.\npoland needs to bring in at least 200,000 immigrants a year over the next decade to keep the current ratio of working-age population to retirees, the country\'s social insurance institution estimated. that figure compares with 188,000 foreigners newly registered with it in 2022 as ukrainians relocated because of the war.\nthe czech republic, where populist billionaire andrej babis was unseated as prime minister two years ago, has since approved higher quotas for visas for workers coming from the philippines and mongolia as it seeks to plug in the gap caused by missing ukrainians.\n"the calls from companies are really desperate," said labor minister marian jurecka. the country will need about 300,000 more foreign workers by 2030 on top of the about 900,000 there are now, he said. "lack of workforce is the main barrier for their growth."\nafter being fed a diet of fear, uneasy electorates are being told the workers are key to investment projects to ensure growth outpaces western europe in coming years. in hungary, china\'s contemporary amperex technology co. ltd., or catl, has started construction on an $8 billion battery factory, europe\'s biggest, near debrecen close to the romanian border.\nacross from the site, some properties are becoming make-shift lodges for foreign workers. earlier this month, as many as 50 chinese laborers were found to be living in cramped conditions in a single-family home, prompting local authorities to launch a probe. polish oil and petrochemicals giant orlen, which has close ties with the ruling law & justice party, is hosting thousands of workers to build its new plant. seven rows of containers sprung up near biala, a village of about 800 people on the outskirts of plock in central poland, where orlen is headquartered.\nthe company started a campaign to reassure locals the influx was temporary, while the police deployed more officers to assuage concern about any rise in crime. it also ran an awareness campaign called "stophejt" to counter racism. leaflets and posters went up around the town and police officers held anti-discrimination workshops in schools. "employing large asian workforce for megaprojects is a new necessity," said jakub zgorzelski, a director responsible for the project. "these projects will need to be built with a large contribution from the asian workforce."\nthat stands in contrast with government rhetoric on the eu\'s plan for member states to take a quota of arrivals from outside europe and relieve the burden on states such as greece and italy. orban told national radio on june 30 the eu\'s proposal would force hungary to "create migrant ghettos." polish attitudes toward immigration will be tested again in october. kaczynski, law & justice\'s chairman and poland\'s most powerful politician, announced a plan to hold a referendum on the eu\'s migrant relocation plan in conjunction with the election. while the party is still portraying itself as the defender of polish identity and security, one of its political weapons is now also a potential source of vulnerability.\nthe opposition, led by donald tusk, a former prime minister and european council president, called out the government last month for letting in 130,000 workers from countries including iran, nigeria and pakistan in 2022. tusk said it was an attempt by the ruling party to stir divisions before the election. the government backtracked on plans to issue as many as 400,000 work permits a year to people from 21 countries including in asia and the middle east.\n"migration is not the most important issue in poland\'s october parliamentary election, but it could become salient if linked to national security concerns," aleks szczerbiak, professor of politics at the university of sussex in the uk, wrote in a blog published on aug. 11. "in a closely-fought contest, it may play a decisive role in determining the outcome."\nin biala, orlen is making efforts to cater to the new workers as well as trying to win the hearts and minds of locals. the "container town" may even have a cricket field and two basketball courts and nearby churches are preparing to hold services in english.\nalso read deloitte launches generative ai incubator for global, indian businesses\nanto darwin, a safety coordinator from india who lives in one of the containers, said people sometimes look at him in a strange way and he was once shouted at by a local. but the 32-year-old native of chennai hopes to stay, regardless. "once my daughter is one year old, i want to bring the whole family from chennai and rent an apartment," he said.\nthat\'s when the economic need for workers and the politics of immigration could collide again. at the moment, the containers are home to about 500 people. as that figure increases, so might tension with the local polish population, said slawomir wawrzynski, mayor of the stara biala municipality. "we emphasize that these migrants are here just to work," wawrzynski said. "there are no problems with the migrants, so the anxiety is suspended. but if the number of migrants increases to a few thousand, which is expected next year, then problems could arise."',
    Summary:
      "Poland's governing law & justice party is seeking a third straight term in what's set to be a tight election on oct. 15. In hungary, orban is being blamed for replacing locals with cheaper asian workers. Most eastern economies in the eu have jobless rates of 5% or lower, and at least 670,000 jobs remain unfilled across the region.

      'the india fix: indian federalism needs to adapt to better manage growing migration',
    Article:
      "welcome to the india fix by shoaib daniyal, a newsletter on indian politics. to get it in your inbox every monday, sign up here (click on \"follow\"). have feedback, interesting links or memes? send them to theindiafix@scroll.in.\nindia, in the words of author vs naipaul, is the land of a million mutinies. however, this past fortnight, the country woke up to a relatively new sort of chaos. large sections of the hindi media started to publish reports of hindi-speaking migrant workers being attacked in tamil nadu by nativist mobs. soon, politicians joined in. the bharatiya janata party began to echo these narratives of ethnic strife as a way of attacking the state governments of tamil nadu and bihar, both controlled by its opponents.\nas it turned out, the reports were a remarkable example of disinformation. videos of unrelated violence had been mislabelled as attacks on migrant labourers in tamil nadu and maliciously spread on social media. from here, they found their way into mainstream media reports and bjp statements. so effective was this misinformation that it almost led to widespread panic, prompting the tamil nadu government to rush out confidence-building measures to persuade north indian workers not to leave the state.\nthat mass panic can be created out of thin air underscores just how critical it is for the indian union to manage the matter of inter-state migration. even more challenging is the fact that it is a relatively new problem for indian politics. unlike communal and caste conflict, ethnic conflict involving migrant labour is something that did not exist in big way till quite recently.\na history\npart of the reason is that, historically, migration across state borders was not very high.\naccording to census data, fewer than 5% of indians are inter-state migrants. in comparison, china has four times that number and the united states nine times. a survey of 80 countries ranked india last on internal migration: the researchers described state boundaries in india as \"invisible walls\".\nmoreover, only a small section of those people moved for work or employment. the number of indians who cross state borders for work is only around 1%. the major reason for crossing borders is marriage, which is socially and politically uncontroversial and usually takes place in culturally contiguous border districts. migration for work, on the other hand, is a politically sensitive topic across the world - and, as is increasingly true, in india too.\neven as the numbers are small in absolute terms, a host of factors have led to spikes in certain states. the 2017 economic survey used analytical methods to estimate changes in migration patterns. tamil nadu, for example, saw its migrant population explode between 2001 and 2011, going up by 39 times. outmigration from uttar pradesh went up by 197% and from bihar by 237%. consistent with qualitative evidence, west bengal became a supplier of labour in this decade, albeit significantly behind states such as uttar pradesh, bihar, madhya pradesh or rajasthan.\ninter-state migration before this was limited by the fact that welfare in india is often provided by state governments. in addition, indian states, many of which are bigger than most countries, exert a politico-cultural hold. however, this is now clearly changing because of two factors. one is economic liberalisation, which is disrupting traditional livelihoods such as agriculture. the second is the significant skew in india's development pattern: almost all industry is concentrated in the south and the west, even as much of the labour comes from the north and east.\nthe rise of nativism\nas migration patterns are changing, so is indian politics. the past few years have seen a sharp rise in nativist sentiment around migration and job reservations for people domiciled in a state. in 2021, haryana passed a law reserving jobs for haryanvis. in spite of the state's significant industrial development, the bjp-led state government was responding to anger around the fact that most industries preferred to hire migrant workers, given their cheaper rates and weaker capacity to organise for labour rights. two years earlier, andhra pradesh had passed a similar law.\nsimilar conversations are taking place in tamil nadu, madhya pradesh and jharkhand around state reservations. in parallel, conflict around migrant workers is rising. in 2018, gujarat saw attacks against hindi speakers and a worker exodus from the industrial state.\nas a result, many indian politicians now see benefit in taking sides when it comes to migration-related ethnic strife. on sunday, for example, the tamil nadu police booked a tamil nationalist leader for makinga speech against migrant workers. this anti-migrant rhetoric in tamil nadu was head in parallel with the bjp purportedly organising in favour of migrant workers as part of its politics in the hindi belt.\nstates are mobilising\nthat said, many indian politicians are also working to genuinely manage this complex situation as best they can. take the tamil nadu panic. the bihar state government refused to get sucked into the politics of the situation and pointed out that the reports of attacks were fake. the tamil nadu chief minister, on his part, met with migrant workers to signal his government's support for their safety.\nduring the chaos of india's shock lockdown in 2020, state governments often took responsibility for their residents in other states, innovating new kinds of politics and policies. kolkata, for example, announced payments to bengali workers stranded in other states. uttar pradesh started to enumerate its migrant workers returning from other states.\nin this regard, jharkhand has emerged a leader. in 2020, it negotiated an agreement with the union government's border roads organisation to protect the labour rights of jharkhandi workers. this was unprecedented. till now, workers had always negotiated in their personal capacity - a system that obviously placed them at a disadvantage. earlier in january, the state also announced the first-even migrant survey.\nas is well understood, migration is highly beneficial economically. it helps both poor, high-population states by providing their residents employment and remittances as well as boosts the economies of the industrialised states by providing them cheap labour to staff their industries. even more importantly, protecting the rights of migrant workers is a moral imperative, given that they are some of the most vulnerable indian citizens.\nthe rise of nativism makes this a challenge but indian states must extensively talk to each other - much as tamil nadu and bihar did just now - to make sure that india's constitutional guarantee to movement remains a living right.\nunless otherwise mentioned, all data is from the 2011 census",

"if i go to calcutta, i won\'t get more than rs 8,000 a month as a security guard. i don\'t see the point in going back to bengal," he said.\nthe issues raised by nur and raj assume significance in the backdrop of an effort by the bengal government on saturday to reach out to 50-odd migrant workers who returned from gurgaon fearing attacks in the wake of communal tension. the west bengal migrant welfare board has assured them of job opportunities in the state.\n"we collected details of those migrant workers who returned home. we will offer them jobs in the construction or hospitality sectors by next week.... if they are interested we will try to deploy them in those vacancies" said samirul islam, the board chairman.\nthe migrant workers who boarded a train on thursday night with their families reached their respective homes in bengal on saturday morning.\nsamim hossain, one of them, said he received a phone from a state official who assured him of a job. "i am really happy to get the call but am not sure what kind of money i will get," said samim. "we are poor people.... that\'s why i went to gurgaon in the first place."',

    Title: 'falling through the cracks: children of seasonal migrants',
    Article:
      'jodhpur, bundi: "what do you want to be when you grow up," i asked 10-year-old shivam, but instantly regretted the question. "i don\'t know," he said hesitantly, "i want to go back to school. i miss my friends." a question that elicits a variety of responses in most school-going children was a non-starter for shivam, who is the fourth child of sabbu singh and kaali bai, who migrate from their village in the jhabua district of madhya pradesh every year to work in the quarries of bundi in rajasthan. this year shivam accompanied his parents, which meant he has dropped out of school for the time being.\nthis migration is usually short-term and is also called circular migration between source and destination, with families usually returning home in time for the sowing season.\nhuman beings have migrated across land and water since the dawn of civilization, seeking better opportunities. distress migration, however, is forced, " mostly for survival rather than profit ". distress migrants, mostly landless labourers and marginal farmers, from areas that are vulnerable to the vagaries of nature, often face an uncertain future in their chosen destination.\nmigrant children have lower nutritional outcomes, are less likely to complete schooling and to benefit from government policies and programmes, our reporting found.\nanalysis of census data by india migration now, a migration research and advocacy organisation, puts the number of child migrants at 63 million in 2011, which includes children who migrate alone as well as with parents or other family. there is no publicly available data for seasonal child migrants.\nindia has over 41.4 million seasonal migrant workers . the festival of holi that marks the advent of spring also initiates the journey of many seasonal migrants, like shivam\'s family. "we usually work for five-six months, until monsoons, when the drilling work in the mines stop," sabbu, his father said. "then we return home in time for the sowing season of the crops." sabbu calls himself a part-farmer, part-labourer--unable to sustain entirely on one for his livelihood.\nsabbu singh and his son, shivam. shivam has had to drop out of school to accompany his parents as they migrate for work.\nlike him, thakur singh of madhya pradesh\'s alirajpur district has also been migrating every year to bundi to work in the mines. "my parents would come here every year to work--i was even born here," thakur said, "this will be my 40th year of coming here." thakur has 3 bigha of land back home where he grows maize.\nsabbu singh, for instance, is a marginal farmer who has 1 bigha land (approximately 0.27 acre) on which he grows maize. "but the yield is just enough for our own consumption and not to earn a livelihood," sabbu told indiaspend . he said he has been migrating every year for the past 20 years to rajasthan to earn an additional income.\nthakur singh of alirajpur in madhya pradesh migrates seasonally to rajasthan for work every year. this year will mark his 40th year of seasonal migration. children of seasonal migrants have lower nutritional outcomes and often drop out of school.\nmost seasonal migrants, said raghav mehrotra of the indian institute for human settlements (iihs), belong to the scheduled castes or scheduled tribes, and "often fall off the radar of policy makers and are invisible even to researchers". "there is no imagination of multi locality in policies," he said, meaning policies aimed at people who live in more than one place over the period of a year.\nthis invisibility is even more stark when it comes to families, particularly children of migrant workers, says researcher divya ravindranath, also of iihs. "migration is always seen as an economic activity. however, and particularly in seasonal migration, it is the entire family which moves as a unit from one place to another," ravindranath told indiaspend .\nmigrant children face nutrition challenge\n"migrant children don\'t have access to anganwadi centres--neither in the place of their parents\' work, nor in their own village," said ravindranath, whose phd was on the nutritional status of children among migrant construction workers in ahmedabad. anganwadi centres are part of the government\'s integrated child development scheme (icds), under which a child up to the age of six, and their mothers, are provided nutritious food, primary healthcare, immunisation, preschool education and referral services.\n"as we know, the first 1,000 days after a child is born is crucial in determining their health for life but a woman labourer who works till the ninth month of her pregnancy and goes back to work after two-three weeks of delivering her child is unable to look after her child well," ravindranath said. her research had found that 50.4% of migrant children were underweight, 40.5% were stunted (short for their age), and 22.1% were wasted (low weight for height). for context, across india, 32.1% of children under five years were underweight, 35.5% were stunted and 19.3% were wasted, as per the 2019-21 national family health survey .\n"the argument that icds is universal still does not provide access to health and other services to these children because they are on the move."\naccess to education\naccording to the unesco global education monitoring report 2019 , in india, up to 40% of children of seasonal migrant households are likely to end up in work rather than in schools. among young people who have grown up in a rural household with a seasonal migrant, 28% identified as illiterate or had an incomplete primary education.\n"there is an overlap of academic sessions in schools (june-april) and the seasonal migration cycle (november-june) on account of which migrant children who have been enrolled in school end up attending only between june and november," unesco said in another report in 2013. this frequent discontinuation often results in their dropping out of school altogether.\n"and in their destination, there are other learning challenges, like language barrier and differences in academic curricula," said mahesh gajera of the aajeevika bureau, a non-profit that works on the issue of labour and migration. "there is no appropriate solution for education for migrant children."\nthe national education policy 2020 , while recognising that "large disparities" remain for socio-economically disadvantaged groups such as migrant communities, says that "alternative and innovative education centres will be put in place in cooperation with civil society to ensure that children of migrant labourers and other children who are dropping out of school...are brought back into mainstream education".\non the ground however, sanjay kumar, secretary, department of school education and literacy in the ministry of education, said that they do not have any data on the number of children of seasonal migrants--the first step to initiate any focused intervention for the group. "the labour department is constituting a database of children of particular age groups who are on the move. this will then be shared with us and we will refer to it for any intervention," kumar told indiaspend.\nagreeing that language is a challenge when it comes to accessing education for migrant children in a different state, kumar said, "initiatives such as bhashini will help translate information from one language to the other, which is in an advanced stage of development. but how would this help the seasonal migrant children will be determined only once we have the data." bhashini is a whatsapp-based chat-bot developed by the ministry of electronics and information technology, which aims to build a national public digital platform for languages so that people have access to information in their language.\nwe also reached out to the ministry of women and child development, and the ministry of labour, for information on programmes for migrant children, and will update the story when they respond.\ndomino effect\nmigrants are still reeling from the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic, even three years after the lockdown, when migrants from across the country rushed home in dire conditions.\nsabbu singh said that he is still repaying a loan of rs 30,000 that he took from a moneylender in his village when he was out of work. "i have five children and a lot of expenditures. my two daughters have to be married, my wife has recently been diagnosed with a thyroid disorder," he said. the economic shock of covid-19, along with the medical needs of the family, have pushed his children into labour. his 19-year-old son works with him in the quarry in bundi, and this year, he sent his 15-year-old daughter to gujarat to work as an agricultural labourer in the cotton fields. "i have sent her with my elder brother...she is earning rs 300 a day, which can be of help to her in her own marriage."\nin a 2013 report on india, the international labour organization (ilo) said that the outcome of migration from villages is \'highly exploitative for children\', with insecurity, abuse, lack of basic amenities, irrespective of who they moved out with. "our research shows that even when accompanied by parents, or known persons, children were put to work on their own for most of the time in conditions where they were exploited."\nchild migrants are broadly categorised as accompanied, unaccompanied and children left behind, as per a commentary published by the social research policy foundation, a charitable trust. unaccompanied children--those who migrate on their own--are at the highest risk of child labour, wrote author raashid shah, in the piece.\npolicies on paper, initiatives on ground\non evaluating policies related to short-term migration, priyansha singh, operations and advocacy lead at india migration now finds a lack of focus on children.\n"from an overall perspective of migrant workers, there are two main gaps (at the policy level): one is acknowledging the unique vulnerabilities of migrants, and second is understanding that there needs to be better integration of spaces with respect to the migrant population," singh told indiaspend. what this means is that migrant children do not just need access to spaces, such as schools, but there should be policies and programmes in place to remove other barriers in the learning process, like the language of instruction.\nin 2019, the ministry of labour and employment introduced four labour codes to subsume 29 central laws. this included the interstate migrant workmen (regulation of employment and service) act 1979, created to safeguard the interests of migrant workers, which was subsumed in the occupational safety, health and working conditions (osh) code, 2020.\nbut, singh said, "nothing much has changed even after the migrant workmen act was subsumed." ravindranath added that the act has "not benefited the workers as much as they should have". although the osh code, 2020 was meant to protect the interests of migrant workers, such as the provision of decent working conditions, grievances redressal mechanisms, toll free helplines and social security, much of it has remained on paper, singh explained. "workers are hardly aware of the act in order to demand for their rights and they continue living the way they have for years," added ravindranath.\nat the same time, there are initiatives across different states, with civil society, to address some of the challenges faced by migrant children.\nin gujarat, for instance, the centre for social knowledge and action (cska) has 70 seasonal hostels for children of migrant workers, 11 to 14 years old, since 2003, across five districts of the state. children can stay back in their villages in these hostels and continue their education when their parents migrate. they also started 100 support schools at work sites, "one of which had teachers teaching in six languages to cater to migrant children from west bengal, chhattisgarh, odisha, rajasthan, madhya pradesh and gujarat", said ashok shrimali, programme executive at cska.\n"we realised the scale of the problem while doing relief work after the 2001 earthquake...if you went to a village, for instance, you\'d see that 60-70% of children who were enrolled in school had almost nil attendance," as they were the children of migrants.\n"the seasonal hostel model was later adopted by the sarva shiksha abhiyan , india\'s school education programme, at the state and central level as an effective model to prevent children of migrant workers from missing out on education," he said.\nsimilarly, aide et action, a geneva-based ngo, says it has been operating worksite schools seasonally since 2017 for migrant children in telangana. most of the parents work as brick kiln workers and hail from odisha. the organisation uses textbooks and mobilises volunteers from odisha, given the language barrier. these schools operate between november and june, based on the migration cycle--and have since reached 5,538 children, according to a report aide et action shared with indiaspend. in 2022, worksite schools were opened for 55 marathi-speaking children whose parents migrate seasonally to telangana for work.\naide et action is also working with the telangana state women and child development department, the health and family welfare department, the police and the samagra shiskha abhiyan (ssa) to ensure that icds services reach migrant children in hyderabad.\nindia migration now\'s interstate migrant policy index , which assessed 28 states and the national capital territory of delhi in 2019, found that kerala, goa, rajasthan and andhra pradesh were the most successful in integrating migrants. kerala was ranked first on three of eight indicators: child rights, education, and health and sanitation.\nkerala\'s project roshni is helping bridge the language gap in accessing education for migrant children by using multiple languages as a medium of instruction in select government and government-aided schools. such was the impact of this programme that, when during the covid-19 lockdown from march 2020, migrants went back en masse to their homes, 90% of the families covered by the programme in ernakulam had stayed back, we reported in july 2020.\nthe state also has other migrant welfare schemes, such as apna ghar that gives rental accommodation to inter-state migrant workers, and aawaz , a health insurance scheme.\ndistress migration, says gajera, will continue to rise because the "reasons they migrate for--poor agriculture and infrastructure in their homes, social pressure, and industrial growth closer to cities and towns--continue to persist".\nfor a more unified approach to addressing the multiple challenges facing migrant workers and their families, including children, suresh gutta, regional manager of aide et action, said that there should be a migrant resource centre in every block of the country. "this resource centre could address all their questions and problems," he said.\nthis story has been supported by work: no child\'s business (wncb).',

    Title: 'why do people choose to migrate in india?',
    Article:
      'in india, rural-urban migration is still seen as a distress-driven choice and not a voluntary one. this leads to a lack of policy measures in ensuring safe and dignified migration for workers.\nbyliby johnson, idr online\nthere are various reasons due to which people migrate from their source (home village, town, or city) to the destination (place of work). one is when individuals who have access to economic resources and a wide social network shift to other countries to set up businesses or for jobs. systems and policiespromotethis type of migration substantially, and its often seen as wealth creation.\ntwo is distress migration, usually considered a coping mechanism at the source region by poorer populations. in india, this is often observed in the ruralurban migration patterns, which could be a result of the failure of peoples primary occupation at source such as agriculture, or due to natural disasters and other factors. in this case, people are forced to migrate, and the reason for migration is seen as something that needs to be prevented.\nthe third kind of migration occurs when people migrate voluntarily from rural india to cities, driven by the aspiration to grow economically and socially. this form of migration is similar to the first type in that it is driven by knowledge about better opportunities outside the source area as well as ones desire and ability to take advantage of those. in this case, migrants look for opportunities in urban labour markets, which may offer higher wages, better working conditions, and more significant career prospects.\nthis last pattern is extremely common in odisha, with migration being a source of livelihoods for many.\nthe ganjamsurat district is one of themajorlabour migration corridors in the country. over the past 10 years, in jagannathprasad block in southern odisha,57.2 percentpeople have stayed for work outside the district for a period of 30 or more days continuously (as of data from 2020). the baliguda block in kandhamal district too has a significant proportion of indigenous communities that depend on migration as a means of livelihoodmore than36 percentof the households in the block have at least one person migrating for work outside the district. for those migrating, their primary occupation is often the one they have at the destination.\nwhat has this meant for villages?\nin the case of odisha, in many blocks, we have estimated the annual remittance to be equal to what the government is spending in that block on development. migrant workers earn approximately inr 6,000 in the beginning when they start to work in destination towns/cities, and graduate to inr 2528,000 per month over time. of this, they are able to remit inr 1012,000 a month to their homes, which is a substantial amount of money. this has led tosignificantsocial, cultural, and economic changes in their home villages.\n1. improved standard of living\nan increase in disposable incomes because of high remittances enables migrant workers to invest in the improvement of their houses, and lease more land. people who are semi-skilled get the opportunity to gain knowledge through working at the destination, which they utilise to make better investments and financial decisions back home. some workers, for instance, choose to invest their money in setting up or buying small shops, rice mills, and autorickshaws in their home locations, which are run by family and friends, creating an additional source of income.\n2. improved social status\nmigration to new places is reshaping traditional sociocultural systems, especially in the context of caste hierarchies at home. it enables those belonging to oppressed castes to explore better opportunities for work at the destination. when they return home, many of them are able to leverage the skills and capital they have acquired to set upnew ventures, such as tea stalls and restaurants.\n3. reshaping of aspirations\nimproved educational infrastructure and exposure to new technologies is helping rural youth reimagine, and act on, their aspirations. they are increasingly inclined to explore career options beyond their traditional family occupations such as farming or fishing. migration, in this context, serves as a means for them to access different livelihoods and better opportunities outside their home villages.\ndespite this, migration is rarely acknowledged as a livelihood strategy for the poor. it is often overlooked in narratives of job creation and income generation and is still considered to be borne only out of distress and never out of choice. this has resulted in a lack of policy focus on creating infrastructures to enable safe and dignified migration.\nwhat needs to change?\nin astudyconducted by gram vikas in 2021, as high as 79.2 percent of the proportion of households in odishas gajapati district shared that they would not have been able to come out of poverty without the income from the migrant members of the household.\nrecognising migration as a voluntary choice people are making to improve their quality of life is the first and most important step in ensuring safe and dignified migration for all. here are some other aspects that need to be considered.\n1. improving banking infrastructure for families back home\nbased on our work with communities in odisha, weve observed that its usually men between the ages of 22 and 30 who step outside the district for work. they leave for a majority of the yearanywhere from eight to 11 months. in most cases, these workers come back either during dussehra or during early harvest/spring festivals, or if the family needs labour during sowing and harvest seasons.\nworkers are unable to transfer their remittances back home through bank services because many areas do not have sufficient bank connectivity. presently, they continue to carry cash with them when returning home. despite the fact that their families back home may have functional accounts, banks are few and far between, making it difficult for people to regularly go and collect the money. the lack of banking infrastructure makes it difficult for their families back home to access cash when needed. addressing the scarcity of banks can effectively resolve this. in a positive step, the odisha government haspartneredwith six public sector banks to provide bank facilities in previously unbanked gram panchayats.\n2. developing better skilling programmes at source districts\nthere has been a growing tendency among boys as young as 16 years old to migrate to the destination areas to earn an income once they look adult enough. this tendency to drop out can be prevented by catering to their needs and providing them with skills that they can leverage to migrate for better livelihood opportunities. however, existing skill development programmes do not suit the requirements of migrant workers from remote rural areas. three types of efforts are needed in this regard:\nmaking vocational skilling centres such as industrial training institutes (itis) more accessible for those with lower education levels, and keeping a focus on developing foundational skills. once this base is set, workers can choose to invest in skill upgradation as and when they feel the need for it.\nstrengthening therecognition of prior learning(rpl), a component of the national skill development system, and making it more accessible to migrant workers. rpl enables the youth to take on industry-relevant skill certifications to help them secure a better livelihood. individuals with prior learning experience or skills can register themselves and get assessed and certi?ed under rpl.\nenabling businesses, especially those in the services sector, to invest in skill development for workers. high turnover rates among lower-level employees in sectors such as facility management, housekeeping, and restaurants pose challenges for small and medium-sized businesses. collaborative efforts involving industry associations and destination state governments can facilitate the skill upgradation of existing workers to address this issue.\n3. creating a portable proof of identity\nidentity is another critical aspect to consider, especially for migrant workers in new locations. aadhaar cards and voter ids often do not suffice because they list their home addresses. this is a huge barrier for workers trying to avail healthcare, public services, and more at the destination, where they need to show proof of residence and work.\nthe one nation one ration card system has not worked effectively in many places. establishing migrant registries at the gram panchayat level and empowering these panchayats to issue identity confirmation letters to migrants could be an important move. these letters would provide a contact number and a reliable reference for a migrants identity, helping law enforcement identify them when they encounter these individuals.\nin odisha, thebiju swasthya kalyan yojanais a positive step as it aims to link hospitals within the system to ensure health insurance coverage for economically disadvantaged communities. currently, private hospitals in kerala are also being linked to the system in order to provide health coverage to migrant workers from odisha.\nin addition to the above steps, certain key measures undertaken at the destination states can also improve the overall environment for migrants:\n1. enabling childrens education and care\nmigration by the whole family is not a very prevalent phenomena in odisha. however, instances of whole families migrating are fairly common in bengal and assam. in such cases, children have limited access to schools and anganwadi services in the destination cities. this may be because teachers and anganwadi workers there are not equipped to deal with children from another region in terms of language, cultural sensitivities, and other factors.\nkerala has made some progress in this regard. schools in the state have a high concentration of migrant workers and parentteacher associations comprise mainly of migrant parents. these schools receive government support to hire para-teachers who can communicate in the local language with the children.\n2. improving living conditions at the destination\nindividuals making the strategic decision to migrate to another place for better livelihood opportunities usually go through their social networks or family members who may already be working at the destination. through these networks, they are able to rent a place, and the amount they are willing to pay in rent depends on the sum of money they want to save and send back home.\nthrough our work we have observed that kerala has better sanitation conditions as compared to places like hyderabad. employer-provided accommodation in construction or factory-based jobs paint a grimmer picture. in surat, where a significant number of odia migrant workers from ganjam district reside, living conditions continue to be poorer than what have been observed in kerala.\nadditionally, a common challenge faced by migrant workers in many destinations is accessing timely medical care. public health systems and clinics often close by the time these workers return from their jobs, leading to difficulties in seeking medical attention. in case of any medical emergency, they risk losing a full days wage.\nwhile there is a lot more that can be done to ensure safe and dignified migration for all, addressing some of these gaps can help. its essential to view migration as a critical component of livelihood policies, and as an opportunity for individuals and communities rather than something that needs to be prevented or discouraged. making migration safe, responsible, and dignified has to be a policy priority, and governments, businesses, financial institutions, and civil society organisations have to work together towards this goal.\nliby johnson\nliby johnson is the executive director ofgram vikas, odisha. he has led large-scale poverty eradication efforts in his 25+ years of social development

      "why migrant workers' issues recur: the absence of data and coordination between states",
    Article:
      'rumours of migrant workers being assaulted in tamil nadu have triggered concern among manufacturers in the state. officials have rejected the reports as fake news, and political leaders and the administration have appealed to workers to not pay heed to the rumours. bihar and jharkhand have sent officials to tamil nadu to take stock of the situation.\nhowever, there are several real issues that migrant workers continue to face around the country. there is inadequate coordination among states on a formal exchange of information on migrant workers. in the absence of data, it is difficult to track labourers during times of crisis.\nwhat is the legal framework for migrant welfare?\nthe inter-state migrant workmen act, 1979 looks into the welfare of the labourers. the act mandates that the establishment which proposes to employ migrant workers be required to be registered with destination states. contractors will also have to obtain a licence from the concerned authority of the home states as well as the host states. however, in practice, this act has not been fully implemented.\nadvertisement\nthis act has been subsumed into the four broad labour codes notified by the centre: the code on wages, 2019; the industrial relations code, 2020; the code on social security, 2020; and the occupational safety, health and working conditions code, 2020. these have not been implemented yet.\nare there any states which have tried to implement the inter-state act?\nin 2012, with the help of the international labour organisation, an mou was signed between odisha and andhra pradesh to track labourers migrating from 11 districts of odisha to work in brick kilns in then-united andhra pradesh.\nkerala has set up facilitation centres for migrant workers whom the state refers to as "guest workers". these facilitation centres maintain data regarding migrant workers arriving in kerala as well as help migrant workers navigate any problems they might face. however, there is no data sharing between kerala and the migrant workers\' home states.\nwhat was the issue between jharkhand and the border roads organisation?\nthe jharkhand government started thinking about migrant labourers\' welfare during reverse migration in the pandemic. the state found out that roughly 9 lakh labourers had returned to jharkhand from across the country.\nadvertisement\none of the employers, border roads organisation - an arm of the ministry of defence - has recruited many labourers from dumka for civil construction in high altitudes, predominantly in the union territory of ladakh. the jharkhand government subsequently engaged in talks between the state and the bro, resulting in signing of a terms of reference in 2020. the state wanted to eliminate what it considered \'predatory\' middlemen. cm hemant soren even flagged off two trains full of labourers to work sites in ladakh and uttarakhand in june 2020.\nhowever, the recruitment did not go as planned. the workers who were recruited with the help of the state government alleged ill-treatment, lack of services and low wages at the bro sites, claiming that this was the case because they went without \'middlemen\' who traditionally take charge of the workers\' lodging and upkeep.\nhow has jharkhand responded to the situation?\njharkhand has started the safe and responsible migration initiative (srmi) in 2021, which aims at enabling systemic registration of migrant workers for monitoring and analysis in the source as well as the destination districts. the priority of srmi is to generate data and then map the labourers who move out to several states for work.\nadvertisement\narindam banerjee , co-founder at policy and development advisory group (pdag) -- which leads the consortium which will implement the srmi and also advises hemant soren government on policy matters -- said that an mou is expected to be signed between kerala and jharkhand wherein nodal officers will be appointed in both the states too look into the issues of migrant workers. he said: "srmi will work towards achieving that in close synergy with the chief minister\'s office, department of labour and other stakeholders. to begin with, the jharkhand government will have help desks--which will be known as \'labour consulates\'--in various states."\nas far as the bro goes, he said "subsequent meetings with ladakh district officials has resulted in mates (middlemen) being registered as labour agencies. these agencies will then form a union registered and verified by the authorities. the union will then provide data on migrant workers data to dumka district administration ...we have been inching towards getting the data which will help us get them linked to various schemes."\nbanerjee added that "currently, migrants can take the benefit of one nation one ration card or ayushman yojna. however, we are aiming to add more benefits and check whether all systems are in place so that they can work safely."\nhave there been any concerns with how the state is operating?\njharkhand janadhikar mahasabha - a civil rights organisation - said that the central government needs to coordinate efforts among states to ensure workers\' rights are taken care of and that only registration of workers will not help until they do not receive social security benefits.\n"the central government seems more focused on weakening labour laws in favour of companies. while the jharkhand government has been significantly more responsive towards issues of workers, it is yet to address basic issues. for example, even now, the registration under the inter-state migrant workers\' act is negligible. also, the state government should not play the role of labour contractors," said siraj dutta, a member of the mahasabha.\nadvertisement\ndutta said that it is the responsibility of the state and the union governments to ensure the implementation of labour laws, the provision of a proper working environment for the workers, and that the workers get decent living wages and social security.\n"only registering workers in a database will not help unless worker rights are ensured and violations of rights are strictly dealt with. to start with, the jharkhand govt should write to all concerned states to ensure these things," dutta added.',

      'written by bernard d\' sami\nthe tamil nadu government was quick to respond to the reports that migrant workers had started to flee the state following rumours that labourers from other parts of the country, particularly bihar, were being attacked. chief minister m k stalin issued a public statement commending the migrant workers for their contribution to tamil nadu and assuring them of protection.\nneighbouring kerala too receives migrant workers. the state has been proactive in initiating social welfare schemes for them. kerala has an estimated 3.5 million inter-state migrants, according to a study commissioned by the department of labour and skills (dols). a study by the gulati institute of finance and taxation (gift), thiruvananthapuram, says the state adds, on average, 1.8 lakh migrant workers annually.\nadvertisement\nwhile tamil nadu uses the term "migrant workers", kerala calls them "guest workers" and "replacement workers". kerala is aware that its own workers prefer the gulf, where they make more money than they could have made in their own home state. the state has identified the corridors of migration. traditionally, kerala has received migrant workers from neighbouring tamil nadu and karnataka. of late, migrant workers have been arriving from up, jharkhand, odisha, bihar, west bengal, and assam.\nkerala is a pioneer in instituting social welfare programmes for migrant workers. the state constituted a working group on labour migration under its 13th five-year plan (2017-2022). the fourth administrative reforms commission (arc) evaluated the implementation of welfare schemes for migrant workers. the education department has launched an inclusive programme for the education of children of migrant workers. one of the goals of the sarva shiksha abhiyan (ssa) is to make the children study in their mother tongue. volunteers have been roped in to teach children of migrant workers.\nin tamil nadu, too, in the districts of thiruvallur and kanchipuram, government schools admit children of migrant labour. for children whose mother tongue is odiya, education volunteers were arranged by the odisha government. hindi books were brought from states such as madhya pradesh.\nin kerala, the kudumbashree initiative for women\'s empowerment and poverty eradication included migrant workers from other states. during the lockdown imposed to deal with the covid-19 pandemic, the kerala government ran more than 15,000 relief camps for migrant workers. community kitchens in panchayats ensured no migrant worker went hungry.\nadvertisement\nthe department of health and family welfare, through the national health mission (nhm), introduced "link workers" in 2020 to enhance access to healthcare for migrant families. leaders identified among these workers were trained to provide information about the state\'s healthcare services. the social justice department has set up mobile creches for children of migrant workers at their places of work and construction sites.\nthe department of labour and skills (dols) of the kerala government launched three "worker facilitation centres", one each in south, central and north kerala. the state has also launched its own interstate migrant workers welfare scheme (ismwws-2010), which includes insurance and housing programmes.\nthere are, however, shortcomings. migrant workers are not generally included in the state\'s trade unions. though the state claims that the workers have collective bargaining power, there are reports of them being left out of the welfare schemes. that said, kerala has never been anti-migrant. the fact that a large number of people from kerala leave the state for work, perhaps, leads to empathy for migrants.\nadvertisement\ntamil nadu too has over 2.2 million emigrant workers; many of them work in singapore and the gulf countries. more than a million tamils are working in other states, according to a 2015 tamil nadu migration survey. it is important, therefore, that the state respects migrant workers and treats them well.\nthe writer is senior fellow, loyola institute of social science',
    Summary:
      "Kerala has an estimated 3.5 million inter-state migrants, according to a study commissioned by the department of labour and skills (dols) The state has received migrant workers from neighbouring tamil nadu and karnataka. On average, 1.8 lakh migrant workers annually, the state adds, on average, 2.2 million emigrant workers. More than a million tamils are working in other states.

    Title: "explained: israel wants thousands of indian workers. here's why",
    Article:
      'new delhi: israel has begun the process to bring in thousands of indian and chinese workers to work largely in the construction industry, in which the country has been facing a crisis for nearly two decades.\nduring israeli foreign minister eli cohen\'s truncated visit to new delhi last month, both countries signed an agreement that would facilitate 42,000 indian workers in israel, out of which 34,000 would be brought into the construction industry. a few weeks later, an israeli government delegation went to china to interview 5,000 candidates for jobs in the construction industry. last year, israel also turned its eye towards morocco to look for recruits for its construction and caregiving sectors.\ntill now, indian workers were primarily involved in caregiving, accounting for a majority of the 18,000 indian nationals in the west asian country. the venture into the construction labour market in israel would be new for indians.\naccording to a report in walla news dated may 29, the indian workers would be admitted to israel in phases - half in the first year. the tally of 10,000 indian workers that was mentioned in the article was, however, much less than what was cited by the israeli foreign ministry.\nthe hebrew article quoted the israel population and immigration authority (piba) as stating that indian workers would be an answer to the "great shortage" in the construction and nursing sector in israel.\nit further noted that "about the foreign workers expected to arrive from india, another wave of workers from china is expected for the construction industry".\nthis year, said the director of foreign worker administration at piba, inbal mashash, 10,000 foreign workers will be admitted into israel for the construction industry, from china, india and moldova. "the entry of workers will help the building industry and increase the supply of residential apartments," she stated.\na report in the london-based website, middle east eye attributed its source to the walla news article with the headline, "israel set to bring 10,000 indian labourers for jobs traditionally held by palestinians".\nwhile the article had linked to the walla news article, it highlighted the influx of indian workers but did not mention that chinese nationals were also being recruited for the same industry.\nthe mee article noted that india\'s government under prime minister narendra modi has forged extremely close ties with tel aviv.\nalso read: in state repression and its justification, india and israel have much in common\nafter stating that the influx of indian workers would be the "most tangible" sign of affecting cooperation in daily life in israel, it commented that 100,000 palestinians work legally in israel, mostly in the construction industry.\nthe mee article does not provide any indication that indian workers will replace palestinian workers. the possibility of a replacement is uncertain, as it would imply a finite number of projects and jobs, suggesting no room for additional projects.\nanother article in the jerusalem post on the same topic of the anticipated surge in foreign construction workers noted that this was taking place against the backdrop of the vocal concern among israelis about the rising cost of living prices, with one of its biggest drivers being the price of housing.\nin 2022, there had been widespread protests about housing prices, with street protests turning into tent cities in the israeli capital. it recalled similar rallies in the summer of 2011 when israelis came out on the roads to protest against housing costs. the last general elections in november 2022 saw both political camps promising to mitigate the high cost of living, which was the top economic issue for voters.\none of the mitigation routes for this two-decade-long housing crisis is to increase the supply. however, israeli workers are not found in adequate numbers for the construction industry.\nconstant struggle over quotas and shortage\naccording to a january 2023 research paper in the peer-reviewed journal migration letters, \'wet works\' in the construction industry are mostly performed by non-israeli workers, made up of both palestinians and foreigners. however, since israel limits the number of non-israelis by setting quotas and levies, it has usually resulted in a shortage of workers in the industry.\nthere has been a constant push and pull between the ministries of construction and finance over the number of permits for non-israeli workers in the construction sector, which means there has been a number of changes in policy over the years, the paper said.\nthe last revision of the policy was in 2021 which increased the number of permits for non-israeli workers in the construction industry by an additional 29,000 workers. this included new permits for 15,500 palestinians and 13,500 foreign workers, as per the paper authored by two israeli researchers.\nthe journal article also examined the factors that are considered while deciding whether the shortage can be addressed by either increasing the quota for palestinian workers or employing more foreign workers.\nthe international labour organisation\'s may 2023 report on "the situation of workers in the occupied arab territories" said that a total of 192,700 palestinians work in israel, one third more than a year earlier. around 60% of palestinian workers are in the construction industry.\nwith unemployment in west bank persisting at a high level, the international labour organization\'s report observed that the palestinian economy and labour was "becoming excessively reliant on israel".\nthe research paper noted that there were two major advantages in employing palestinian construction workers. "the palestinian workers do not live in israel and therefore their employment does not affect the socio-demographic composition of the state. in addition, the employment and economic well-being of these workers could, among other factors, contribute to the calming relations between israel and the palestinians," it said.\nat the same time, the disadvantage was their distance from their homes to the workplace and the need to cross checkpoints daily. "in cases of security clashes and border closures, palestinian workers do not come to work in israel".\nthe researchers concluded that the near-equal division of work permits between palestinian workers and migrant workers in the 2011 policy revision suggests that the israel government "has no unequivocal preference regarding the origin of non-israeli workers that should be added to the industry".\nhowever, even additional foreign workers from india, china and beyond, as per the increased quota, may not be enough to address the critical dearth of manpower in the housing sector. a senior official of the israeli contractors and builders association told the jerusalem post that there would still be a shortage of 15,000 workers after the latest move by the israeli government.',

    Title: 'mystery of a 20-room house in kandhamal',
    Article:
      "daringbadi, odisha: a huge, unpainted house stands on the outskirts of jidingimala village, in an area surrounded with forests and hills, in odisha's kandhamal district. its scale is in sharp contrast to what you see around, a neighbourhood where people mostly live in smaller houses or huts.\nkandhamal was once one of india's most underdeveloped districts. it still ranks 29th out of odisha's 30 districts on the state's human development index. however, the symptoms of abysmal poverty that previously characterized its villages--children dying of starvation, tribal moms exchanging kidneys for food, houses that are one rain away from destruction--are gradually vanishing.\nthe house we are interested in has about 20 rooms distributed evenly along a long corridor. the walls, however, aren't symmetrical. they appear slanted from certain angles. there's a reason why. no professional developer or architect was engaged. it is being assembled by nimindra pradhan, a farmer turned migrant worker, whose life far away from home made him rather prosperous.\npradhan has already finished doing the walls, the rooms and the roof himself to cut labour costs, relying on the skills he picked up as a migrant construction worker in kerala. he has spent over rs27 lakh already. switchboards, plywood, windows, glass, and other materials needed to complete the construction have been purchased.\n\"i always wanted a big house. i want my children, as well as my nieces and nephews, to experience living in a large house. even if we stop migrating, we will have this until the end of time,\" pradhan says. \"there's no point in having money if it's useless to you. what's the point of keeping money in the bank?\" pradhan asks.\nwell, the house will also give him bragging rights--he can tell villagers his story, his transformation from a humble dhoti-clad farmer living in a hut to the owner of a spacious property.\nthis transformation underlines the impact of domestic remittances--every rupee used in the purchase of materials and construction in pradhan's case has come from remittances.\nindia's labour market has 'supplier' states, or states with abundant supply of labour. for instance, odisha, bihar, west bengal and uttar pradesh. labour from these states often migrate to states where there is demand for jobs, like in south india. the supplier states can't absorb their labour because there aren't enough businesses. industrial activity in kandhamal, for instance, is modest and generates very few jobs. farm employment is increasingly considered as unsustainable because it is seasonal and pays very little. non-farm labour is scarce, unless it is obtained through public job-generating programmes. many skilled and unskilled people make their way to kerala.\nthe state's plantation workers are now primarily tribal couples from jharkhand and chattisgarh. fishermen from the sundarbans in west bengal come to beypore, a fishing hub in kozhikode district. in the suburbs of kochi, kerala's economic capital, carpenters are from uttar pradesh, while labour for the wood industry and restaurants come from odisha.\nin 2017-18, the kerala state planning board, an advisory board under the state government, estimated that kerala had 3.1 million migrant labourers from northern and eastern states such as odisha. by 2030, migrant workers will number 5 million. according to the kerala-based centre for migration and inclusive development, an organization that studies migration, migrants send home at least rs20,000 crore every year.\nthis remittance money is constructing a new world, rewriting narratives, and weaving dreams into reality--back in the 'supplier' states. just like pradhan's, money sent home by migrants has shored up the finances of many other families. several neighbourhoods in the state are seeing a wave of change. houses with asbestos roofs and mud walls are being rebuilt with concrete. people are spending on white goods and bikes, reflective of rising aspirations. this, by extension, is good news for all companies trying to sell in rural india, from auto makers to fast-moving consumer goods firms.\nstyle and the city\ndaringbadi, a hill town in kandhamal district, is known as odisha's kashmir--it can get very chilly during the winters. the place is home to over 100,000 people, 85% of whom live below the poverty line. for years, they largely relied on subsistence cultivation. that seems to be changing.\nmahesh kumar sahu, one of the town's top cement suppliers, says there are more buildings being constructed than ever before. his annual earnings have grown to rs5 crore in the last five years, from rs50 lakh earlier. he has benefited from remittances.\nthe state government is chipping in with affordable housing programmes, but that would only cover a portion of the funds needed to complete development, sahu says. remittances fund the rest.\n\"migration has changed this place. if you had visited us five years ago, you would not have seen anything of what you see today in this town,\" sahu tells this writer. \"every day, new buildings and houses are constructed. daringbadi is a different town now.\"\nnot just bricks and mortar, the lifestyle of people has changed as well. ask chandrakanth pradhan, a resident of daringbadi and a migrant carpenter in kerala's pala town, home to many syrian christian families.\nsyrian christians were among the first communities in kerala to embrace a more western lifestyle and this reflects in the architecture of their houses. they entertain guests in living rooms. the dining rooms and kitchens are well separated from the bedrooms. there are attached toilets to each room. the floor-plan isn't linear--the entrance and exit doors will almost never be aligned.\non the other hand, daringbadi's houses are often built in a straight line, with the front door aligned to the back door. the rooms are divided along a tunnel-like passageway. many houses have toilets outside the main building.\nthe palas enchanted pradhan. so, he utilized remittance money to renovate his home into a pala-style residence. the villagers were amused and his relatives chastised him on a daily basis. they were perplexed by the zigzag floor plan. they asked him, \"how come it's crooked?; how will the air get through?\"\ntravelling closer to the forested areas of daringbadi block allows one to better understand the transformation. many people share large domed huts in remote forest settlements, cultivating crops or grazing animals. they are less travelled. unlike their counterparts in towns or the bigger villages, they lack the network and means to obtain jobs in other states. roads, phone towers, and schools are few.\nholiday in kashmir\nan astounding number is at the heart of the story in odisha's ganjam district: rs140 crore. according to gram vikas, a non-governmental organization, this is the amount remitted to ganjam every month.\nas per its study, the money mostly comes from migrants who work in the textile hubs of gujarat's surat and the industrial labour in central kerala. the money has had a tremendous influence on even relatively modest places like kalamba village in the district. as you move past the green fields and lanes, away from roaming cows, you notice a series of banks.\nsabhyasachi, an official at a state bank of india (sbi) customer service point in kalamba, informs that daily transactions at his office often cross rs3 lakh, with withdrawals accounting for 70% of them, an unusually high number.\nlike in kandhamal, this influx of money is erecting sturdy roofs that protect against monsoon and storms; fund education for children in the family; help them eat better meals. pamphlets advertising holiday travel packages are pasted in many places in the village. these packages include tours to jammu and kashmir, uttarakhand, haryana, punjab, and rajasthan. the cost of the packages range between rs10,000 and rs25,000, and many locals appear to be going, says akshay kumar pradhan, a resident. his sons are migrant labourers. \"i've gone twice, once to vrindavan and the second time to varanasi,\" he adds with a smile. both vrindavan and varanasi are holy towns located in uttar pradesh.\nthe village, he believes, is witnessing a certain competitiveness. \"if someone is wearing a nice shirt, we wonder, why can't i? why can't i have the nice bike you are riding? if you can go on tours, why can't i?\"\ntaste of parotta\none migration-driven transformation, and a heartening one, is that of local entrepreneurship. there is not enough of it today, but we did notice a few examples.\ntwo brothers, anantha and sumanta baliarsingh, worked as restaurant cooks in kerala. this inspired them to open their own restaurant at daringbadi, three years ago. called 'jihowa taza tawa hotel', it has a special item on the menu--the kerala parotta, a flaky, layered bread made of refined wheat flour.\ntheir no-frills roadside restaurant initially drew a few curious onlookers, mostly, from women and children who had heard about the parotta from the migrant men in the households. gradually, it gained in popularity. some upper caste men in the village then created roadblocks. \"we are dalits. so, they were upset about us offering food and upper caste people in the village eating it,\" anantha explains.\nbut this was a temporary disruption, lasting only a few days. the eatery's parotta had become so popular that villagers forced them to resume operations. the opposition was silenced.\nyet another tale of entrepreneurship, in the backdrop of large-scale migration, comes from kerala. it is about operating a bus, covering a distance of more than 1,800km. that's the approximate distance between kandhamal district and kerala's ernakulam.\ntitto mj started excel cabs, a 35-seater bus service, during the covid-19 lockdown, when migrants from central kerala were looking for a reliable transport service to take them back home to darringbadi. what began as a single trip has now expanded into a weekly bus service. it has also made life much easier for migrant workers. in places like daringbadi, workers have to travel nearly 100km to the nearest railway station. with most of them carrying heavy luggage, the journey was difficult and expensive. on the other hand, titto's bus picks them up from their town.\nexcel cabs charges around rs3,500 per person. titto tried out a more expensive service--the roads wind through difficult terrain and sleeper seats would be comfortable, he thought. however, migrant workers didn't take to it.\ncash & empathy\nmeanwhile, migration watchers say kerala is more empathetic to the cause of workers because of its own history--malayalis associate the incoming migrant labour with their own exodus for years, most notably to the gulf countries.\nevery third kerala house has a male working in the gulf, according to a study by the centre for developmental studies, a kerala-based research institution. the combined remittances--from the gulf and other countries--total more than rs1 trillion each year and has shaped kerala significantly. but, the 'missing men' phenomenon affected the state's labour market. given the state's high education levels, many menial jobs go unfilled, and migrants fill the gap.\nin short, the demand for labour and the steady supply of reliable workers from odisha have now culturally bonded these states. the parotta making its appearance in odisha and the pala town's influence in daringbadi are just two examples.",
    Summary:
      "In 2017-18, the kerala state planning board estimated that k Kerala had 3.1 million migrant labourers from northern and eastern states such as odisha. The state government is chipping in with affordable housing programmes, but that would only cover a portion of the funds needed to complete development, sahu says. Many neighbourhoods in the state are seeing a wave of change. People are spending on white goods and bikes, reflective of rising aspirations. The state is also seeing a lot of money. The government is trying to improve the quality of their homes and a new world. The town of ernakulam and ernkulam, which is being made available for the state's ernackulam.

    Title: 'how long will migrant workers remain outside of policy discourse?',
    Article:
      "until the covid-19 induced migration crisis of 2020 highlighted the sheer scale of migration in the country, migrant workers in india's cities had largely been invisible. one fundamental reason that migrants were, and continue to remain invisible, particularly to policy makers, is that there are no accurate estimates of the extent of migration in india. official data sources such as the census, the national sample survey (nss) and the periodic labour force survey (plfs) are not designed to appropriately capture migration as the focus of the census is on population distribution, while nss and plfs data are concerned with labour market attributes. these surveys massively undercount migrants and underestimate migration in the country, specifically short-term and circular migration.\nthat said, census data reveals that patterns of rural-urban migration in india are from poor to prosperous states, that is, from backward to advanced regions. such a migration needs to be situated in a context of growing agrarian distress in source regions and increasing inequalities between source and destination regions. the major 'migrant-sending' states are uttar pradesh, bihar, rajasthan and madhya pradesh, while maharashtra, delhi, gujarat and haryana comprise major 'migrant-receiving' states. migration to the southern states has also substantially increased in recent decades on account of increased employment opportunities and higher wages in destination areas.\nempirical studies show an increase in these inter-state, rural-urban migration streams. for instance, in my book, migration and development in india: the bihar experience, based on longitudinal data at the institute for human development (ihd), i show that in rural bihar, the share of households with migrants increased from 45 per cent in 1999 to 65 per cent in 2016. this rural-urban migration is in response to increased demand for labour in india's cities; for several decades, particularly in the post-liberalisation period since the early 1990s, india's cities have grown, developed, and prospered, riding on cheap labour of rural migrants who predominantly work in the informal economy in urban areas. migrants are the backbone of india's service-oriented urban economy that demands cheap labour from rural areas, and this demand has only increased over time.\nthough migration has increased, and migrants spend much of their adult working lives in the city, their migration remains 'circular,' that is, migrants eventually return to the village and retire in rural areas. the income earned by rural-urban migrants at the destination is often below the statutory minimum wage and is inadequate for family migration or long-term settlement. thus, it is the rural areas that bear the cost of production and reproduction of labour, subsidising india's urban development. the majority of inter-state migration streams for work are male-dominated and masculinised. as rural migrant workers can hardly afford to bring their families to the city, they are forced to separate from their loved ones, who stay back in the village. this enormous social and psychological cost of migration continues to be absent from the policy discourse.\ndespite being abandoned by the cities during the lockdown, migrants who had returned to their native villages trickled back to cities in search of work as rural material conditions are dependent on urban remittances.\nin destination areas, the circularity of migration can also be understood through the lens of 'exclusionary urbanisation.' despite contributing to urban growth and development, migrants remain strangers to india's cities, and are subject to multiple precarities, vulnerabilities and exploitation. it emerged during the pandemic that not all destinations are the same; there is substantial variation in the sub-national state policies for migrant workers. to better understand such variations, varun aggarwal and colleagues at india migration now (a migration data, research, and advocacy organisation) created impex--interstate migration policy index. the tool captures policies of destination states towards migrants in eight areas: labour market, education, child rights, social benefits, political inclusion, housing, domicile and identity, and health and sanitation. in designing impex, scores are assigned to 63 policy indicators in these eight areas. this exercise enables an evaluation and ranking of states on the basis of how they fare in their treatment of migrant workers with regard to migrant inclusion and integration policies.\nit emerged that all destination states took minimal initiatives to provide effective access to employment, social benefits and healthcare for migrants. kerala had the highest impex score--its policies were most considerate of migrants. on the other hand, delhi had the lowest score, followed by gujarat, tamil nadu, haryana, punjab and maharashtra. it is interesting to note that these traditional destination states fare far worse than kerala, a relatively recent destination for migrant workers. aggarwal and his colleagues argue that kerala's state welfare system, historical labour-friendly policies and declining fertility rates explain the enhanced importance of migrant workers in the state.\nthe proactive role played by the state of kerala during the covid-19 lockdown is well-known. it organised relief camps for migrant workers and provided rations and food through community kitchens. while migrant workers elsewhere in the country scrambled to return to their villages, in kerala, they were able to stay put due to the support provided by their employers and the state.\na study conducted at pradan by nitya rao and researchers to examine the experiences of migrant workers from jamui district in bihar spread across multiple destinations in india found that migrants in maharashtra, uttar pradesh and gujarat faced immense hardships, including threats from the police, as they tried to return to their native villages. in contrast, adivasi migrants in kerala were offered aid from the district collector's office in getting tested for covid-19, and upon testing negative, local officials provided support in identifying procedures such as registering for the special train from kerala to jharkhand. unlike the horror stories from the shramik trains, the train from kerala was equipped with food and medical facilities, and a migrant worker summed the journey as being \"smooth and the behaviour of the kerala officials was very humble.\"\nkerala has the most generous social security architecture for migrant workers; it was the first state in the country to introduce the inter-state migrant worker welfare scheme in 2010 with the department of labour and skills running housing and insurance schemes for migrant workers. policies at the destination matter, and the example of kerala shows that where there is political will, social policy can be humane and can ensure economic welfare and social justice.\nthree years since the covid-19-induced lockdown, the state of a majority of migrant workers in the country continues to be precarious. despite being abandoned by the cities during the lockdown, migrants who had returned to their native villages trickled back to cities in search of work as rural material conditions are dependent on urban remittances. heightened public awareness and sensitivity about the plight of rural migrants during the lockdown have not translated into measures and policies to ensure their protection and well-being. on the contrary, employment, wages and income are still below pre-pandemic levels. the pandemic and subsequent economic downturn have been associated with increasing informality and rising nativism in india's cities. this, in a myriad of ways, has led to a backlash against, and further marginalisation of, migrant workers.\nno country in the world has progressed without a majority of its population moving from rural to urban areas. the circularity of migration mentioned above has implications for india's urbanisation project, which is excruciatingly slow. a sluggish rural-urban transition in a context where 69 per cent of the population lives in rural areas is a serious impediment to india's desired structural transformation. this requires a radical rethinking of the relationship between the rural and urban and how urbanisation policies can be more just, humane and inclusive towards migrant workers. how we treat migrants is intricately linked with the future of development in india.\n(views expressed are personal)\namrita datta is the author of migration and development in india: the bihar experience",
    Summary:
      "Migrant-sending states are uttar pradesh, bihar, rajasthan and madhya pradesh. Migrant-receiving states include maharashtra, delhi, gujarat and haryana. Migrants are the backbone of india's service-oriented urban economy that demands cheap labour from rural areas. Migrant workers can hardly afford to bring their families to the city.

running between chennai and madurai, nobody expected that it would frighten migrant workers throughout southern india and keep the state government on its toes.\nthe incident came to public notice when a co-passenger recorded the abuse on his phone and shared it on social media.\nthe video shows magimaidas grabbing two migrants by their hair, beating them, and yelling expletives at them and prime minister narendra modi.\nthe video went viral, simmering tensions between hindi-speaking migrant workers and tamils.\non february 21, magimaidas was arrested. he alleged that he lost control when a migrant worker stepped on his feet, in return for which he thrashed them and yelled expletives at them.\nmedia frenzy\nby then, various videos of instances unconnected to tensions between hindi-speaking migrant workers and tamil locals that occurred in the past in coimbatore, tirupur, hyderabad, and parts of rajasthan and karnataka were circulated on social media, instilling panic among migrant workers. to worsen the situation, politicians from both northern and southern india took sides and aired divisive statements.\nchallenging the rights to freedom of movement and to work, social media posts claimed that vadakkans (north indians) have no place in tamil nadu and accused them of stealing jobs from locals.\naccording to a press information bureau (pib) report, as per the 2011 census, there are 34,87,974 migrant workers, including 7,13,888 women, in tamil nadu. only maharashtra and andhra pradesh have more such workers among all states and union territories.\ntalking to the leaflet, andrew henry william, who leads work on internal migrants with the jesuit migrant service in chennai, said that "it was a few north indian media [outlets] which had \'screaming\' headlines there locally about alleged tensions between tamils and north indian migrants."\n"yes, there was an incident on a train where a migrant worker was physically abused by a tamil. somebody had recorded and shared it. the rest of the videos circulated were old and unrelated," william added.\naccording to him, when the hindi media carried stories, without fact-checking, the families of migrant workers began panicking and started telephoning them.\n"you know how the fake news spreads. other than this, there is no problem at all," he added.\nfollowing the tensions, william and his team members in tamil nadu visited migrant labour camps to pacify the worried workers.\n"we even held some online sessions to tell everyone that all is well here and there is nothing to worry about," he noted.\nwilliam has been leading the organisation for nearly ten years, and his team runs informal classes for migrant workers\' children and conducts medical camps for them.\ntalking about the supposed workers\' \'exodus\', he confirmed that it was holi season and the workers had gone to celebrate the festival with their families.\n"majority of them are back in tamil nadu," william, who visits workers\' camps frequently, said.\nmohan chand, a 28 year-old construction worker in chennai from bihar, told the leaflet that "all is well and they are safe in tamil nadu."\n"it was [some] north indian media and a few irresponsible people who were sharing unrelated news to create panic. we had to call our families and tell them that all is well here," chand added.\nground reality\nquoting sources, the indian express reported that "jharkhand government officials who visited tamil nadu were happy in understanding that their workers are safe."\nmeanwhile, the hindu reported that the "economic offence unit (eou) of bihar police has tightened the noose to catch the mastermind manish kashyap who created the panic by spreading fake videos on social media about bihari migrants being allegedly attacked in tamil nadu."\ntalking to the leaflet, dr benoy peter, executive director of the centre for migration and inclusive development, an independent non-profit organisation working with internal migrants in kerala, also confirmed that "fake news was behind all the panic."\n"what makes me happy is that both states acted immediately and responsibly to control the situation. a delegation from jharkhand arrived in tamil nadu and the tamil nadu government also worked with the delegation to find solutions. such visits had never happened in india in the past," dr. peter stated.\nmeanwhile, william told us that registration for migrant workers is not happening on the eshram portal properly.\n"we are trying to get registration of migrants as much as possible, but these workers don\'t carry aadhaar cards and ration cards with them. so, documentation becomes difficult," william added.\ndeveloped by the union ministry of labour and employment, the eshram portal was built to create a national database of unorganised workers, which is seeded with an individual\'s aadhaar.\naccording to william, tamil nadu supplies one kg of rice for one rupee. but as migrant workers don\'t carry ration cards with them, they buy the same card for rs 8-10. in the market, other rice prices go to as much as rs 30 for a kg.\nright to move and work anywhere in india protected by constitution\nas per article 19(1)(e) and (g) of the constitution, all indian citizens have the fundamental right to reside and settle in any part of india, and to practice any profession, occupation, trade or business.\nglobally, article 13(1) of the universal declaration of human rights (udhr) states that everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state. india is a signatory to the udhr.\ntherefore, every indian has the right to move anywhere in india, settle down there, and work there. tamils can work in bihar, and biharis can work in tamil nadu.',

      "food, housing, health- limitations of post covid-19 migrant workers' related policies",
    Article:
      "image courtesy: economictimes.indiatimes.com\ngiven the return of covid-19 in china, and concerns of repeat of the situation we faced in 2020, it becomes important to understand what kind of legislative elements india has to deal with the pandemic related changes.\nmigrant workers are an essential element in the journey of india from an agriculture-dependent country to a manufacturing and service sector dependent country. whether this transition is sustainable and viable is subject matter of an alternate debate. in a diversely populated country, however, worker migration is a by-product of the mode of development chosen and promoted without necessarily adequate deliberation, since the most impoverished (and often deliberately displaced) sections of the populace moves to \"developing regions\" to make a living. it is of course a different debate that this development is itself skewed, unsustainable when it comes to environment and climate change -therefore often not holistic - and disproportionately concentrated both geographically and sectorally.\nindia saw one of the most serious migrant worker crises during the 2020 covid-19 lockdown, where migrant workers in different parts of the country were abandoned by government and simply could not find the means to travel to their hometowns and villages. they were forced by an unconcerned and apparently paralysed state machinery to simply walk hundreds, thousands of miles (kilometers) to their homes. since then, different programmes have been initiated by governments, geared to address the concerns of migrant workers. the results of the implementation of these schemes is yet to be seen but this article provides a brief overview of these recent policies, aimed at protecting migrant workers. the scope of this article is limited to the themes of health, housing and food security for migrant workers.\nnew labour codes\nbefore going into the schemes as above, it is important to note that the new labour codes passed by the centre does have a major detrimental effect on the rights and livelihoods of migrant workers: this is because the chapter on interstate and migrant workers under the occupational safety, health and working conditions code, 2020 specifically (almost deviously it would seem) excludes any obligation on establishments that employ less than 10 workers. with 70% of the establishments in the country employing less than 6 people according to the sixth economic census 2013-14, a majority of the establishments have been wilfully excluded from this act thereby snatching away, at the inception whatever protections that are enshrined in the act. in addition to this structural exclusion, the e-shram portal that has been launched by the government aims to record the data of the unorganised workers including migrant workers, construction workers. this measure, the government hopes will give it the required data to make preparations whenever required for the purpose of providing assistance, support and protection to migrant workers.\nfood security\none nation one ration card\nin a bid to extend the public distribution system to unorganised workers who are in different cities, the government had launched this scheme, even before the pandemic. this scheme allows workers, particularly migrant beneficiaries, to claim either full or in part food grains from any fair price shop (fps) in the country through existing ration cards coupled with biometric/aadhaar authentication in a seamless manner. the system also allows their family members back home, if any, to claim the balance of food grains on the same ration card. the implementation of onorc was initiated in august 2019.\na prima facie concern about this scheme -publicly expressed- is that the digitisation of the records means that for those who do not have the respective digitisation i.e, aadhar card or a smartphone, stand excluded. the scheme is therefore, at its inception, exclusionary. a survey also found that the transactions in a different city or a state were being denied 4x (multiple-fold) more than at their registered centres. [1]\na recent study has also found out that not all ration shops are equally attractive (or accessible) to migrant workers. only 8% of fair price shops conducted 80% of the transactions involving interstate migrants. this skewed reality exists much less for transactions in delhi.[2]\nhealth\nin the health sector, the inter-state migrant workmen (regulation of employment and conditions of service) act, 1979 necessitates that the contractor who is employing the interstate workmen to provide for the prescribed medical facilities to the workmen, free of charge. it is however a very volatile paradigm to rest the whole health of the inter-state migrant workmen on the contractor.\nthat is before the controversial occupational safety, health and working conditions code, 2020, the health and working conditions of the workplace i.e., the responsibility to maintain the working conditions and protect the health of the worker, is vested almost or entirely, on the contractor or the principal employer, another relatively volatile assumption or paradigm.[3] various disparities exist, both health and financial, migrant workers experience financial stress to meet the expenses of the healthcare burden. although the access to health insurance increases the access to health care and decreases financial stress, the reach of the insurance schemes is very low.[4] a legal regime that places responsibility on one agency or one entity so that healthcare access can be streamlined is unrealistic. the basic responsibility of the state in this crucial sector, is conveniently avoided.\nsince migrants go to new places within an alien state, depending on the work they do, the importance of the infrastructure for them is not recognised as well. for example, there have been studies that flagged the lack of infrastructure for defecation and the consequent open air defecation leading to unhygienic living conditions and diseases. [5]\nhousing\na survey in ahmedabad and different construction workers who live on site has found that there are no places for decent living and sanitation, drinking water and other water sources. it was also found that open defecation exists and is prevalent in the sites.\nthe pradhan mantri awas yojana (pm-ay) has been promoted as india's \"biggest\" housing policy initiative, with a goal to provide 20 million affordable housing both in urban and rural areas. under the scheme, government-funded housing in the cities have been converted into affordable rental housing complexes (arhcs) under the ppp mode through concessionaires. this is also the first scheme where segregation amongst the urban poor and migrant workers (as different classes of population) has been made.\nthe affordable housing rental complex (ahrc) scheme acknowledges the needs of mobile workers who spend short periods of time in the city and do not seek permanent housing.\nmodel 1 of the scheme that relies on the retrofitting of vacant public housing, and will, arguably, add a mere 88,236 units of rental supply, nationwide. the demand for affordable and secure rental housing would likely be several lakhs in each metropolitan city in the country. to meet this, the arhc would need to expand its ambit considerably. the provision of public land and fiscal incentives could entice developers to sign up for model 2 of the scheme, which is currently totally unattractive for the private sector. bringing small-scale housing entrepreneurs who are currently supplying informal rental housing into the scheme through tenure regularisation, financing support and technical assistance programmes is another way to expand the reach of arhc.[6]\nconclusion\nthe section of migrant workers that is often overlooked by the state government since they do not form the electorate and therefore, the implementation of policies for migrant workers become hard. therefore, firstly it is important to create coordination between state and central governments with respect to the implementation of any schemes.\nan over emphasis on digitisation to enable availing of schemes is especially exclusionary in the current scenario.\nrelated:\nmigrant diaries: tinku sheikh\nmigrant diaries: dilip rana\nmigrant diaries: mohammed jamaluddin\nmigrant diaries: sagar ali\nmr prime minister, please save lives!\npictures of labourers' migration may be the future of india's farmer: skm\nmigrant workers' journey home remains a challenge, shame on the gov't!\nthe deaths of migrant workers in india\ncovid-19 lockdown: migrant workers begin to leave city in a painfully long walk home\nindia's workforce demands fiscal support following the second wave of covid-19!\n[1]derrek xavier, addressing the gaps of the one nation one ration card scheme\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/developing-contemporary-india/addressing-the-gaps-of-the-one-nation-one-ration-card-scheme179075/\n[2] sarthak agrawal, archana agnihotri\nfood security for interstate migrants- an empirical analysis of the onorc, vol. 57, issue no. 51, 17 dec, 2022\n[3] section 60, inter state migrant workers, occupational safety, health and working conditions code, 2020.\n[4]bhoi s r, joshi s h, joshi a (october 31, 2022) out-of-pocket health expenditure among migrant workers in india: a narrative review. cureus 14(10): e30948. doi:10.7759/cureus.30948\n[5] divya balan, health and safety of interstate migrant workers in india during covid-19: inadequacy of the labour laws\nhttps://grfdt.com/publicationdetails.aspx?type=articles&tabid=10129\n[6] mukta naik, india's home rental programme for migrant workers needs more nuance and ambition, https://indiahousingreport.in/outputs/opinion/indias-home-rental-programme-for-migrant-workers-needs-more-nuance-and-ambition/",

      "migrant workers' scare in tamil nadu: how the state became a destination for inter-state migrants",
    Article:
      'written by sushovan dhar\ndisconcerting news about hindi-speaking workers in tamil nadu has been in the air in the last few weeks. such stories did their rounds on social media much before they hit local or national headlines.\nit all started when two videos allegedly showing migrant workers being beaten up went viral on social media and whatsapp groups. amidst a string of rumours and accusations, images of migrant workers queuing up for trains in different parts of the state added fuel to the whole story.\nadvertisement\nthe tamil nadu government has strongly ruled out any anti-migrant hysteria, admitting that workers from north india were integral to the development of the state\'s infrastructure. the police registered a case against four persons, including bjp spokesperson prashant umrao and two journalists, on charges of spreading false news over the alleged attacks on migrant workers in the state. the state hosts over a million migrant workers, with the bulk of them concentrated in chennai and its industrial satellites of tiruvallur and chengalpattu. the remaining are mainly based in the textile and industrial hubs of tiruppur, coimbatore and erode. indeed, the hotel industry, textile and infrastructure, are heavily dependent on migrant workers.\nhistorically, tamil nadu used to be the source of migrant workers, mainly to karnataka and kerala, and to a lesser extent, andhra pradesh. however, with increased industrialisation and urbanisation in the 1990s, the state began to experience labour shortages in the manufacturing and service sectors. this drew workers from the country\'s backward industrial zones, mainly from the north and east. what began as a trickle has grown to become the most important source of labour supply. the entire manufacturing and service sectors in chennai are increasingly reliant on migrant labour. there is no doubt that a large segment of these workers is engaged in precarious work with little job security or decent pay. nevertheless, such informal employment is comparatively attractive to workers who have very little access to most forms of livelihood in their home states. in the words of one such worker, "in chennai, we are paid rs 400 to rs 600 for a day\'s work, compared to rs 75 to rs 100 in bihar." in effect, tamil nadu, from being a source of migrant workers, has evolved into a destination state for a bulk of informal sector workers. chennai is a destination for 4 per cent of the inter-state migrants in this country.\nthe ever-expanding employment of migrant workers in various sectors across the state poses challenges. employers primarily choose migrant workers as they work for much lower wages as compared to local people. in the case of the construction industry, a migrant worker can be hired for rs 600 per day, whereas the latter demands a daily wage of rs 1,100-1,200. secondly, outsiders are less likely to self-organise for collective demands for increased wages, social security, or decent work conditions. this has resulted in discontent among a section of local people. however, it is unlikely that such disquiet has led to organised hatred against migrants.\nmust read | the express view: a doubtful green cover\nthe tamil nadu police and state officials, as well as fact-checkers, have pointed out that the circulated videos depict situations that did not occur in the state or are unrelated to the claims being made. however, industry experts say that such campaigns have created fear among migrant workers, some of whom are leaving the state. fact-checkers have pointed out that the videos were of other situations, and not from tamil nadu. these clips, some of which are old, were from telangana, rajasthan, and karnataka and had nothing to do with the false claims of assaults on hindi-speaking workers.\nadvertisement\nsecondly, investigations by both government agencies and others have not found enough evidence of targeted attacks against migrants in the state. experts believe that the employers of migrant workers are influential in the state. it is unlikely that they will sit back and watch developments that impact their industries.\nthe state government has taken measures to assure non-tamil workers. it must initiate proper inquiries about this spate of undesirable incidents and punish the real culprits. it must also ensure that, beyond measures of physical protection, the migrant workers are paid minimum wages and receive social security benefits. this will also help erase tensions between "us" and "them".\nthe writer is director, india labourline',

      "The tamil nadu government has ruled out any anti-migrant hysteria, admitting that workers from north india were integral to the development of the state's infrastructure. The state hosts over a million migrant workers, with the bulk of them concentrated in chennai and its industrial satellites of tiruvallur and chengalpattu. Experts believe that the employers of migrant workers are influential. It is unlikely that they will sit back and watch developments. The state government has taken measures to assure non-til workers. It has not found enough evidence of targeted attacks against migrants in the state. Experts say that it is unlikely they will sitting back and watching developments that impact their industries.",

      'migrant fears in tamil nadu: migration is a constitutional right, a symbol of hope and prosperity',
    Article:
      'tamil nadu (tn) is one of the key destination states for more than a million interstate migrant workers, who are often unskilled, informal and low-wage earners. these migrants play a crucial role in the state\'s economic growth as well as that of the source states. the recent social media rumours in tn about attacks against migrants reportedly kept them away from work. their absenteeism badly affected the state\'s industries, creating state-wide panic and raising several concerns, especially for north indian migrants. consequently, many migrant workers started to leave tn for fear of being attacked.\nofficials said that the exodus is due to holi, and they will return to work once it concludes. we do not know the truth -- however, one cannot deny that despite being critical contributors to states\' economies at the destination, interstate migrants work while facing insecurities, anxieties and suspicion that stems from their migratory identity. hostility and negative attitudes towards migrants are not new, and several such incidents have occurred in the past in maharashtra, assam and delhi, to name a few states. their victimisation is deeply rooted in the politicisation of migrants, the stigma, power dynamics of the labour market and scapegoating, which need to be understood with broader and intersectional perspectives.\nthe native population becomes envious and hostile when migrants take up jobs that locals reject and occupy the labour market often due to better skillsets than native labour. along with skills and flexibility, the wage rate of migrants is often lesser. in a conversation with the interstate migrants in kerala, they told one of us that "we get more wages than in our states - assam, west bengal and orissa -- but we never receive \'kerala wages\', which are much higher and offered to the local, malayali workers". this wage differential means that employers often prefer recruiting migrants.\nadvertisement\nthe strong antipathy towards migrants starts with "sons of the soil" politics, and results in conflicts between "insiders" and "outsiders". the constant fear of the native citizens for losing their cultural and ethnic identity and employment opportunities results in antagonism, sometimes, even violence against migrants. however, one must understand that these migratory identities are a socio-political construct, conveniently stigmatised for political advantage to please nativist groups.\ninterstate migrants are selected as "scapegoats" as they are the easiest targets. scapegoating is a psychological process that describes prejudice and discrimination as a means to express hostility arising from frustration. say, a state has failed to provide quality education, develop essential skills and create ample employment opportunities for its native population. to hide such failure, or to provide an emotional outlet for distress among nativist groups, a scapegoat is selected to release people\'s aggression. in such a situation, interstate migrants are the best substitutes as they are highly fragmented, unorganised and precarious and cannot defend themselves against violent acts. so, they are portrayed as outsiders stealing local jobs.\nduring the nationwide lockdown, the failure of urban governance and poor healthcare infrastructure and social security mechanisms to stranded migrants in cities was visible. this, perhaps, diverted attention from the pandemic anxiety. consequently, migrants were stigmatised in many quarters as "carriers of infection" and "a burden on systems". they were under suspicion, frequently humiliated and portrayed as "unwanted" in the host cities and even at their place of origin. after the pandemic, the suffering of migrants was normalised as no major steps were taken for their welfare and strengthening the social security framework.\nmigrants are not only victims of physical violence but also of structural violence, entrenched and embedded in the socio-economic and political structures, rendered invisible, and manifested indirectly, with institutionalised trajectories that make them extremely vulnerable and systematically isolated. the structural violence against interstate migrants closely intersects with the politicisation of migrants and their stigmatised identities, exacerbating their risks, vulnerability and marginalisation.\nadvertisement\nanother major concern is that violence or the constant fear of it adversely affects the mental health of migrants. in the absence of family, care groups and support mechanisms, the rumours on social media, fear and panic result in enormous stress, anxiety and mental health crises.\nthe critical question is: how do we protect physically and mentally interstate migrants at their destinations? promoting their unionisation, portability of entitlements and ensuring universal social security provisions at the destination state could prove fruitful. stigmatising migrants and politics of scapegoating are psychological apparatuses used for political benefits -- hence strong and committed political will and bureaucratic structures are required to reduce xenophobic and violent acts against migrants.\na serious concern to protect interstate migrants from all forms of violence must be reflected in the draft national migrant labour policy and its future implementation. parallelly, one must take adequate steps to make migrants aware of their legal and civic rights by providing legal-aid and counselling services. policy-level efforts should be taken to make urban centres more inclusive, adaptive and resilient.\nadvertisement\nwe believe that there is a need for more migration surveys in states like tn to estimate inter-state migrants, similar to the kerala model of migration surveys. the ongoing migration surveys in odisha and jharkhand, with which one of the authors of this article is associated, have helped in generating a more nuanced understanding of migrants and have also aided in better policy-making in both the states of origin and destination. other origin states such as bihar, assam, west bengal, rajasthan and uttar pradesh could also benefit by emulating the model of both odisha and jharkhand and carry out large-scale migration surveys to examine the various contributions made by low-skilled migrants for the improvement of their households, economy and society.\nto conclude, migration is a constitutional right in india and a symbol of hope and prosperity. attacks on migrants, rumours, and their persistent precarity indicate that we have forgotten the migrant crisis during the pandemic. without comprehensive and substantial steps, the meaningful inclusion of migrants is a mere dream.\nirudaya rajan and rajput are chair and senior research fellow, respectively, at the international institute of migration and development (iimad), kerala, india',

    Title: 'have the migrant workers returned to their homes?',
    Article:
      "they are still walking. can't you see? sometimes it takes a heart to see, not eyes.\nduring covid-induced lockdown, they were palpable as we were glued to the screens, not busy enough with the drudgery we call work. the fear of imminent death and cocooned grief of losing near and dear ones made people a bit susceptible to the surroundings of our existence. and the long walks, the migrant workers, india's often forgotten underbelly, made them discernible to us.\nthe hitherto unfelt presence of countless people who remain nameless as we don't bother to know their names --jalwala (waterman), dudhwala (milkman), raaj mistri (mason)-- who make our life easy every day suddenly become poignant. the fear, agony, and uncertainty of catching the virus and dying alone without even a decent, respectful burial were thick in the air and it brought out many aspects of humanity -- both humane and inhumane, but mostly the latter.\nthe unplanned lockdown that began on march 24, 2020 hit the most vulnerable, the fragile mass of india, as badly as any thoughtless plan hits them. but this time, it could be seen, though neither felt by the state nor by the indifferent well-to-do classes. they could not undo the seeing. thousands were walking silently, without being violent, without demanding justice, without demanding a respite, as if they knew the blatant truth that democracy is a thing to celebrate one day -- the day of the election. they were so absent from the imagination of the state an policymakers that they did not even think about how these people would return before announcing the lockdown.\nhave they returned yet? have they returned home? we all long to return. have they crossed the rail track safely or are they still dying leaving behind the rotis, the reason they are forced to work a thousand miles away from home? rotis are not merely food, but a symbol of the only dream this 'bheed' --crowd-- or mass strives to achieve.\nwe are at peace that we --the indifferent india-- don't see them on the road now. again, they are just 'bheed', a faceless, voiceless existence. the unsettling images of india's obscene poverty and ruthless inequality that were visible during the lockdown have gone into the shrunken, esoteric fold of india's willful act of unseeing project of false development narrative. the development narrative where these people don't fit into. it's a killing too, a killing by throttling voices, a death by willfully not hearing their voices.\nwe don't have any clear data on the exact number of people who work as migrant workers. it shows the sorry state of affairs. what about their medical insurance, their living conditions, and their families whom they leave behind? we don't have an answer. no one is ready to listen to their man ki baat.\nthey have not reached home yet. most of the time, they cannot make it. on the rail tracks, in the jhopris, in the buses, they breathe their last. we don't see them. sometimes, they find a space in the corner of the newspapers. but they can never make the distance between 'seen' and 'unseen', 'presence' and 'absence'. they have never been abandoned because no one has ever owned them, neither the government nor the society. they are failed every day.\nso when russel, 19, told me he is again going to return to work as migrant labourer in bhutan, it didn't surprise me. last month, he returned from kerala where he worked as a migrant worker and sent money home for potato cultivation. his family has faced huge losses in potato cultivation. now he is going to bhutan to work as a construction worker. this circle will go on and on. in my village of bakali in the northern part of west bengal, most of the young people work as migrant labourers in kerala or bhutan. minor boys go to kerala as it does not need id cards. but entering bhutan requires an id card.\nnayan, a mother of four children, met her husband while working as a migrant worker in mumbai. nayan is from murshidabad from where 1.4 million people reportedly work in other states as migrant workers. after her marriage, she came back to her village in murshidabad. her husband had a dream to educate their children. they got their children enrolled in schools. her husband went back to work in a hotel, but this time to kerala. he was sending money from there and nayan was working as domestic help in her village. she had a broad smile every time i met her. and she had a dream: \"didi, meye ke porabo (will make my daughter educated).\" but a few months ago, her husband died. and again, she had no choice but to go back to the 'bheed' of mumbai, leaving her two elder sons behind to her mother. some are not allowed to dream!\nin the village schools of the rural parts of bengal, particularly in the districts of malda, murshidabad, or coochbehar, in every classroom when enquired students often say they stay with their grandparents because their parents work as migrant workers. this is another reason for child marriage. the parents can't take their grown-up daughters with them, so they feel it safe to get them married as early as possible to get rid of the 'problem'. yes, daughters are still a 'burden' in this society. in these schools and madrassas, the number of students who are enrolled but not attending classes is increasing.\nso this 'bheed', this voiceless mass, is still wandering. maybe not on foot now but in the crumpled general compartment or buses. now as we have enough noise, and enough visuals of the so-called development, we can't hear their voices anymore.\nmaybe still, the 18 labourers --whose names we never want to know-- who hid in a cement mixture tank to return home during covid-induced lockdown are on the road with different names or in different ways. as a poet i can only give them my poems, a poet's helpless witness to the darkest time.\ndharmveer -- a migrant in his own country\ndharmveer was cycling\nhe was cycling from the land of big buildings\nand sumptuous food that\nhe tasted the smell many times\nbut he didn't have any.\nhe built those heartless buildings.\nhe used to have a sound sleep\non the graveyard.\nin big cities, the makers live in graveyards\nand the lumpen dead souls\nhave big buildings.\ndharmveer was cycling.\nhe could see the bubbles of the rice gruel\nabout to fall from his mother's dixie\non the hearth.\nhe was following the path of\nthe smell of boiling rice.\nhe had to cross two thousand kilometres\nand fell many times\nbut followed his dream of\nwhite rice and garlic chutney.\nsuddenly at twelve hundred kilometres\nhis dream of one gulp of boiled rice\ngot blurred with indistinct vision.\nhe looked upwards\nnot for the last blessings of god\nbut for the noise of the powerful blades\nof a helicopter.\nhis hungry vision saw\nthe white dream of rice fell from the sky.\nhe opened his mouth for a fist of boiled rice.\na petal kissed his dead lips.\nthe dream of steamed rice\nwas slipping from memory.\nhe fell from cycle for the last time\non twelve hundred kilometres\npetals are cheaper than rice.\n(this poem is inspired by the story of dharamveer, a migrant worker who died while cycling back to his home during lockdown. this poem is from the collection, the musings of the dark, published in 2020.)\nthoda distance maintain karo (maintain little distance)\none by one\nthey are coming out\nnot from your 3bhk\nnot from antilla.\nthey are coming out from a single hole\na hole\nso black, so deep, so hell\nthat you don't dare to peep into.\nit's the hole of the entire

    Title:
      'how to build skills, provide social protection and protect livelihoods of migrant workers?',
    Article:
      "for origin-states and regions, migration reduces the glut in the labour market and increases remittances. for the destination states, it adds to the economic dynamism of the region through provision of labour, work experiences, and skills. migrants gain an opportunity to earn higher wages and cultivate new skills and experiences, acquire greater independence and agency, as well as participate in the economic development of the destination and their families and host communities back home.\ngiven india's demographic patterns, inter-state migration is likely to continue to grow. over the course of the next few decades, the growth in the working-age population will be driven by northern and central states that lag behind in the demographic transition, such as uttar pradesh, bihar, madhya pradesh, and rajasthan. these states will see their working-age population increase through 2041 and supply labour, especially low-skilled labour in sectors such as construction, retail, care, beauty and transport to the aging states in southern and western india.\ninternal migrants are heterogeneous in terms of education, incomes, skills, social location, and age, among other characteristics. micro-surveys indicate that most migrants are between the ages of 16 and 40 years, particularly among temporary seasonal migrants. census 2011 indicated that there 45.36 crore migrants in india, equivalent to 37 per cent of the country's population. most migrant workers are employed in the informal sector in unskilled or semi-skilled manual jobs. the indian economy is critically dependent on this internal migrant workforce that contributes to the high-growth sectors of manufacturing, construction, and trading activities such as hotels, restaurant, shops, and wholesale and retail trade, and other services in the destination states.\naccording to census 2011, more than 35 per cent of seasonal migrants worked in construction, 20 per cent in agriculture, and 16 per cent in manufacturing sectors. a large proportion of gig and platform workers, who are ubiquitous in urban spaces, delivering food and ferrying passengers, are migrants from rural and semi-urban areas, who migrated to the cities in search of jobs and better wages.\ndespite their contribution to economic growth, migrants face a host of challenges such as lack of access to social protection, poor living and working conditions, language and cultural barriers, discrimination based on social location, precarity of livelihoods, and so on.\nrecent initiatives for migrant workers\nthe covid-19 pandemic affected all sections of the population, significantly impacting the lives of migrant workers. in this backdrop, many initiatives were undertaken by the centre and state governments to mitigate the effects of the covid-19 pandemic and to support migrant workers.\nministry of rural development (mord) launched the garib kalyan rojgar abhiyan (gkra) to provide immediate opportunities for livelihood generation to returnee migrant workers and the rural population in 25 categories of economic activities covering 116 districts of assam, bihar, madhya pradesh, odisha, rajasthan, and uttar pradesh. these districts were selected given their high concentration of unskilled or semi-skilled migrant workers.\nthe ministry of skill development and entrepreneurship, under its flagship scheme pradhan mantri kaushal vikas yojana (pmkvy), implemented a targeted programme for the skilling of reverse migrant workers who were adversely affected by the pandemic in the 116 districts identified by mord through the recognition of prior learning (rpl) and short term training (stt) components.\ndistrict skill committees, the locus of skill planning and skill training efforts at the district level, were given the responsibility of mobilisation of candidates, identification of candidate aspirations and expectations, and facilitation of training in batches based on local livelihood opportunities. job roles such as mason, self-employed tailor, sewing machine operator, assistant electrician, and organic grower were identified and nodal officers were designated to support and monitor the district authorities. once skill mapping of all migrants was done, the details of skilled migrants were uploaded on the aseem portal, a skilled workforce directory, for the benefit of industries. msde also introduced online skill training in short-term and long-term courses through the eskill india portal and bharat skills portal respectively.\nat the directive of the ministry of labour and employment, states undertook tremendous efforts in mapping the skills of returnee migrant workers, identifying reskilling and upskilling needs, and linking workers to local livelihood opportunities. states such as karnataka, uttar pradesh, rajasthan, and madhya pradesh, among others, launched mobile apps and government portals to link workers to jobs, social security schemes, and skill development.\nkarnataka's kaushalkar.com web portal became an interface for mapping of skills, evaluation of skilling needs, and job opportunities. the karnataka skill development corporation worked in tandem with industry associations such as karnataka small scale industries association (kassia), federation of karnataka chambers of commerce and industries (fkcci), and others to boost job opportunities for migrant workers.\nwith a focus on women's economic empowerment, the government of andhra pradesh implemented 'mahila prangnams' for skilling women. uttar pradesh launched the 'sewa mitra' platform under the aegis of the department of labour to collect data of more than 37 lakh migrant returnees, map their skills, and categorise them into over 100 skill sets across the skill spectrum. details of approximately 18 lakh construction workers, registered with the building and construction workers (bocw) scheme, were added to the platform.\ncivil society organisations had a very strong role to play with skill centres run by aajeevika bureau witnessing an increase in enrollments in short-term courses such as bike-repair by migrant workers. aajevika also provided and continues to provide on-the-job training to migrant workers in construction, factory work, and hospitality industry in cities in maharashtra and gujarat, catering to their specific skilling needs. this enables higher wages, better placements, and improved worker self-esteem. online training courses run by private companies also saw an uptick in interest, with migrants eager to acquire new skills as they sought to re-enter the labour market or open an enterprise.\nskill development for migrant workers\nthere is a spatial dimension to migration, with regional specialisation in certain trades and occupation categories. for instance, interstate migrant workers from odisha are often engaged in the plumbing trade, whereas migrant workers from uttar pradesh are frequently employed as factory workers and drivers. given that spatial migration trends are quite entrenched, focused skilling and vocational training programmes for youth in the origin states can help migrants access better-paid, skilled work opportunities in the destination and break from the intergenerational transmission of poverty. skills in digital technology must form a part of the skilling programme modules.\nfor the destination states and regions, establishing migrant facilitation centres where workers can register themselves, obtain information on government schemes, post their grievances through help desks, and be provided immediate counseling and support is an important intervention. in 2015 and 2016, the ddu-gky, mord's flagship skilling programme, released detailed guidelines regarding the setting up of migrant support centres (mscs) for migrating candidates and their families. ddu-gky envisaged mscs to provide residential assistance, counselling, identity documentation and registration services, alumni and employer networks, healthcare links, and other support services to migrant candidates. in order to facilitate the creation of an institutional support framework for migrants, ddu-gky provisioned funding of rs. 10 lakhs per centre per year through state rural livelihood missions/state skill missions. this was increased to rs. 30 lakhs per centre per year in 2020. given that migrant workers face challenges in accessing formal, quality skill training, and post-placement support, the mscs are an important intervention and need to function in close coordination with the mole.\nmoreover, given the presence of the informal sector and dynamic nature of the labour markets, assessing the demand and supply of skills and match-making of skills in both the source and destination states is a herculean task. however, skill needs analysis can be attempted using a mix of qualitative methods --case studies, interviews, fgds-- and quantitative methods-- surveys, skill assessments, modeling estimates-- at the state and district levels.\nsocial networks\nfield research indicates that the elaborate social networks of interstate migrant workers, comprising family, relatives, and friends, enable and assist the process of migration. in fact, strong community solidarity facilitates exposure to a range of occupational pathways, as well as acquisition of vocational skills through observation and learning by doing.\nwhile male unskilled construction workers rely on urban networks to provide access to important information, public services, and alternative employment prospects, women garment workers depend on social ties and associations with workers and ngos to access loans, shgs, and training.\nas is well-documented, in the indian ecosystem, skills are frequently acquired through non-formal means, that is, skills are inherited and passed on through learning from one generation to another through family and kinship networks of master crafts-persons. workers marginalised from formal labour markets, such as low-income migrant women workers in the construction and garment sectors, workers from pastoralist communities engaged in urban services, etc. rely on social and community networks and generational skills for skill acquisition and opportunities for upward social mobility.\nskill assessment and certification of migrant workers through recognition of prior learning (rpl) will augment worker competencies, scope for employability and upward mobility, and enable substantiation of existing knowledge. the rpl certification of prior formal, semi-formal, and non-formal skills is a valid skill acquisition and certification method, recognised in existing skilling programmes such as pmkvy. there is a need to scale up the rpl framework and capture the numbers of those skilled in different sectors and crafts through informal skill acquisition.\nlabour laws and data\nto protect the interests of the inter-state migrant workers and provide them with rights at par with the local workers, the centre passed the inter-state migrant workmen (regulation of employment and conditions of service) act, 1979. this act has now been subsumed in the occupational safety, health and the working conditions (osh) code. the osh code provides for decent working conditions, minimum wages, grievance redressal mechanisms, protection from abuse and exploitation, enhancement of skills and social security to all categories of workers including migrant workers. furthermore, legislations like unorganized workers' social security act and bocw act have been subsumed in the code on social security (coss), 2020.\nthe ministry of labour & employment launched the eshram portal in 2021 to create a comprehensive national database of unorganized workers, including migrant workers. there are currently more than 28.62 crore workers registered in the portal. going ahead, it is envisaged that the portal will facilitate a mapping of the delivery of welfare benefits to such workers, including portability of benefits of welfare schemes to the migrant workers.\nthe way forward\nthe process of mainstreaming migrant workers in the policy discourse has been initiated through various initiatives in the domains of social welfare, skill development, and awareness building, with momentum picking up in 2020 after the pandemic-induced exodus. to support the pandemic-affected migrants, a whole range of initiatives were introduced by the centre and state governments. taking a long-horizon view of migration, investing in the potential, productivity and agency of migrant workers is crucial. skill development programmes in source states need to be designed to meet growing demands in emerging sectors. specialised training as care workers which have demand both within india and abroad would have the potential to provide employment opportunities in the growing care economy. skill development in source states needs to be accompanied by soft support such as language skills, travel assistance etc. that can enable skilled persons to embark on the journey of migration and get accustomed to a new setting.\nlocal migration resource centres need to be set-up in high intensity areas to offer support and help establish linkages with social security schemes. civil society and grassroots organisations can play an important role in supporting local governments in running migration resource centres and helplines for migrant workers. initiatives to ensure access to toilets and other basic facilities for health, hygiene and sanitation for women migrant workers would be critical. access to education, health, and nutrition for children of migrant workers need to be ensured through integration with government schemes and health and education facilities.\n(the authors are associated with the skill development, labour & employment, niti aayog. views expressed are personal.)",
    Summary:
      "These states will see their working-age population increase through 2041 and supply labour, especially low-skilled labour in sectors such as construction, retail, care, beauty and transport to the aging states in southern and western india. There are 45.36 crore migrants in india, equivalent to 37 per cent of the country's population. Despite their contribution to economic growth, migrants face a host of challenges and challenges.

opportunity to look at the economics and politics of migration in india.\nwhile the bulk of intra-country migration in india involves blue-collared workers, and this is the main area of concern for this week's column, one should not lose sight of the fact that post-reform india has seen a significant amount of white-collared migration as well. the most visible example of the latter is the proliferation of suburban townships along with the growth of it-based industries in cities such as bengaluru, hyderabad and delhi-ncr (gurugram and noida).\nto be sure, india did see white-collared migration into big cities even before the it revolution. while the national capital attracted people from across the country such as central government employees, mumbai, the commercial capital of the country, attracted both salaried and business-oriented richer migrants from many other states such as gujarat and even southern india from a much earlier period. it is not just a coincidence that mumbai emerged as the most cosmopolitan city in terms of linguistic diversity, as was shown by an ht analysis of census data by vijdan mohammad kawoosa.\ndifferential migration, differential politics\nwhen richer migrants take financial control of a city, politics takes a very different route compared to how the migration of poor workers changes it.\nthe most prominent example of a nativist backlash against such domination is the growth of the shiv sena, which, under its founder bal thackeray, started its politics by consolidating the marathi-speaking population in (what was then) bombay against the growing financial clout and white-collar employment share of non-marathi speaking people.\nthe sena enjoyed strong political tailwinds from its tactics of protecting the interests of marathi workers and went on to become the strongest political force in the city. for those who are interested, sociologist dipankar gupta's nativism in a metropolis: the shiv sena in bombay offers an excellent account of the sena's political rise. among other things, gupta's book also tells us that sena's political rise was as much militant nativism as it was attacking the left-controlled trade unions at the behest of capitalists (including non-marathi ones) which were replaced by grass root branches or shakhas of the sena.\nto be sure, the nativist strategy of the shiv sena ran aground much before the party ran into a crisis, which has now culminated in a split with thackeray's son having been left with the minority faction after his refusal to play junior partner to the bjp in the state. while part of this crisis is on a cultural front -- niranjan rajadhyaksha had discussed some of these in a mint article written after the death of bal thackeray -- an equally important, if not bigger, reason is economic, namely, migrant blue-collared workers from poorer states such as uttar pradesh and bihar offering their labour at a much cheaper rate than marathi workers.\na lot of low-income service sector jobs in mumbai, especially in the gig economy, are now with migrant workers for the simple reason that they are willing to accept much worse working and living conditions which marathi-speaking workers will not. while the latent discontent against the lowering of wages and crowding out of local labour by poor migrant workers manifests itself in occasional episodes of violence against the latter and makes big headlines, the more fundamental political economy question of what drives such migration is often ignored in the popular discourse.\nthe drivers of blue-collared migration\nthe migration of poor workers, even of the indentured variety, is very old in india and has inspired rich literature, both in fiction as well as academic research. the supply of such labour is self-explanatory. workers only leave their homes for work if they cannot find work which is remunerative enough.\nthe source of demand for such work is slightly more interesting. it is useful to begin this discussion with research which looks at labour migration in tiruppur, one of the most important industrial belts in tamil nadu. a 2014 paper by muniandi jegadeesan and koichi fujita looked at migrant workers from both tamil nadu and north indian states in tiruppur, one of india's biggest textile hubs to understand the dynamics of the labour market.\nthe entry of north indian migrants into this textile hub was triggered by a historical accident of sorts. it involved a confluence of shortage of tamil labour due to reverse migration on account of a good agricultural season at a time of large demand for the textile industry in tiruppur. this was accompanied by the arrival of north indian labour to work on central government road construction projects which had been awarded to companies from outside tamil nadu in 2004-05.\n\"after the road construction was completed, however, the labourers did not return home. rather, they looked for other jobs and finally found jobs in tiruppur, because industrialists in tiruppur were considering how to overcome the aforementioned mounting problem. they tried to solve the problem by introducing cheap labour from north india, and their needs happened to coincide with the interest of north indian labourers looking for jobs at that time. subsequently, many north indian migrants started to flow into tiruppur, based on information from their friends and relatives. in fact, a large-scale migration from north india started around 2008-09, and it has been estimated that there were approximately 100,000 north indian labourers in tiruppur in recent years\", the paper says.\nthe north-indian workers agreed to work on fixed monthly wages (lower than the rate for tamil workers); they had very low attrition rates; and they had a smaller problem of alcohol consumption-induced absenteeism, the paper writes, while adding that they made ends meet and even saved some money by cutting back on their spending which entailed compromising on the quality of food. there is good reason to believe that stories of almost all long-distance blue-collared migration in india have their roots in similar historical processes.\nthe paradox of the city\nlest one gets the idea that migrant workers are doomed to face only exploitation in cities, it is important to remember that almost all of them (except a minority who are victims of trafficking) migrate out of their own accord. what motivates such migration?\nthe economics of it is straightforward. not only should wages be higher than the native place of the worker, but they should also rise in proportion to (what is a very truncated) cost of living. \"give me rs4,000 per month in gwalior, rs6,000 in gurgaon, rs9,000 in delhi, and rs18,000 in mumbai; my bags are packed and tell me where you want me to go\", manish sabharwal who runs teamlease services wrote in an opinion piece published in ht in 2018.\nhowever, it will be a mistake to believe that only pull factors (of a higher wage) drive long-distance blue-collared migration in india. often migration is also an escape from extra economic exploitation and claustrophobia in the worker's native place.\nin the paper referred to above, jegadeesan and fujita list caste violence in tamil nadu as a major reason for the migration of migrant workers from tamil nadu's villages to tiruppur.\na 2016 paper published by amrita dutta in the economic and political weekly buttresses this line of argument. the paper, based on fieldwork in bihar, argues that the availability of work outside the village has allowed socially weaker groups to escape exploitation at the hands of upper-caste villagers who were economically far more powerful when the only work in the village was on their farms.\nin fact, migration could feel empowering even when there is no exploitation involved. in her excellent book in the shadows of the state: indigenous politics, environmentalism, and insurgency in jharkhand, anthropologist alpa shah describes such migration (of tribal workers from jharkhand into brick kilns in west bengal) with a lot of (counterintuitive) clarity.\n\"whereas jharkhandi activists are able to talk about migration to the (brick) kilns in terms of a human-rights discourse--as a movement to be stopped on the ground that it furthers adivasi exploitation--the migration enables many migrants to reject the jharkhandi tribal elites' notions of an authentic, morally pure adivasi citizen of the state. ironically, the spaces of freedom provided by the brick kilns may serve to maintain older notions of the self. thus, rather than being a phenomenon dictated by mere economic necessity, migration to the brick kilns may also be seen as part of a distinctive tapu politics of challenging the purifying discourse of the adivasi state\", shah writes.\nif shah's academic language is too dense to understand, recall the freedom from persecution offered by migration to the young couple who escapes to the city after an inter-caste marriage invites a violent backlash in the critically acclaimed marathi film sairat.\nto be sure, migration is often a harbinger of economic rewards by allowing people to pursue occupations which social stigma would not allow them to pursue in their native places. in their book, how lives change: palanpur, india, and development economics, himanshu and his co-authors give a fascinating example of how upper caste villagers from palanpur village in uttar pradesh were willing to do manual work with lower caste workers outside their village but not inside it.\nthe political impact of migration\nas someone who came to delhi from bihar more than two decades ago, it is difficult not to begin this section on a personal note. when this author came to delhi as a young student, the term bihari was often used in a pejorative sense outside the sanitised spaces of university and college campuses because an overwhelming number of bihari migrants were extremely poor and engaged in low-paying jobs.\ntoday, no party can hope to form a government in the city-state without the support of the poorvanchali (read bihar and eastern uttar pradesh) voter. political parties now compete with each other to attract this section of voters by trying to appropriate their religious festivals. a lot of members of legislative assembly (mlas) and even members of parliament (mps) in delhi today are of poorvanchali origin.\nwill things reach such a pass in mumbai, tamil nadu or kerala as migration of workers from north and east india continues? even if it does, such a situation is a long time away. when it does happen, the cultural clash will be bigger than what it was in a hindi-speaking delhi.\nelectoral politics aside, how does blue-collared migration affect the broader political economy? a natural question to ask is whether migrant workers make common cause with their local peers or even migrant workers from other states.\nin his 1996 cult classic work on labour migration in india, footloose labour: working in india's informal economy, jan bramen was sceptical about such a possibility.\n\"early discussions of informal sector workers living in urban slums implied that, once roused to political consciousness, these people would foment radical movements and eventually join hands with the rural poor in a frontal attack on the established social order. i have found no evidence to back up such a scenario. the closed-shop character of most sources of employment in the segments of the rural and urban economy which were the focus of my research prevents proletarian consciousness from being transformed into class solidarity and its manifestation in class struggle\", bramen writes.\ntwo-and-a-half decades after this was written, there is little evidence to suggest that migrant workers have developed a militant class consciousness. the biggest proof of this was seen during the lockdown in 2020 when hundreds of thousands of migrant workers accepted the trauma inflicted on them without much of a political protest.\ndoes this mean migrant workers are completely apolitical? it will be wrong to jump to such a conclusion. the political activism, or lack of it, of migrant workers, who often reside in urban slum clusters, might be directed towards very different areas than a class conflict in the classical sense of the term, which in any case is becoming a rare commodity in india.\nthe question of democratic consciousness\nthe scholarship on these questions, and this includes the larger problem of understanding the political economy of informal sector workers, is far from settled in india.\nit is useful to end this column by quoting from a welcome addition to the existing wisdom on this issue. in their recently published book, migrants and machine politics: how india's urban poor seek representation and responsiveness, political scientists adam michael auerbach and tariq thachil look at political processes in india's urban slums. \"for the slum residents at the heart of our book, acts of contentious politics are central to their efforts to advance their material conditions. these activities range from small acts of group claim-making that assert demands for public services, to slum-wide protests involving hundreds, sometimes thousands, of residents\" auerbach and thachil write.\nwhile the initial enquiry into the fake news of attacks on bihari workers in tamil nadu suggests that the first rumours started from the ranks of bihari workers in tamil nadu, it will be wrong to use this example to paint all migrant workers as either troublemakers or gullible beings who fell for such fake news and started running back to their home state in panic.\nauerbach and thachil's research suggests that slum residents are among the most invested and active practitioners of day-to-day democracy in india. \"slum residents actively shape the structures that govern them. what is even more remarkable is that they do so through processes that reflect democratic deliberation and a willingness to work across ascriptive divisions that too often result in sectarian strife. those with the least means routinely demonstrate--from small acts of claim-making to larger, more boisterous acts of protest--the power of ordinary citizens in defending, deepening, and demanding democracy\", they write.\nevery friday, ht's data and political economy editor, roshan kishore, combines his commitment to data and passion for qualitative analysis in a column for ht premium, terms of trade. with a focus on one big number and one big issue, he will go behind the headlines to ask a question and address political economy issues and social puzzles facing contemporary india.\nthe views expressed are personal",

    Title: "muslim women workers in india: what the data doesn't tell us",
    Article:
      "this is the ninth article in a 10-part series supported by the john d and catherine t macarthur foundation. this series highlights lessons and insights of organisations working at the grassroots to build more resilient, inclusive communities in light of the covid-19 pandemic.\nsocial structures have always played a role in widening economic divides, and the covid-19 pandemic made matters worse for those marginalised by gender, religion, caste, and their intersections. muslim women, who constitute only one-tenth of the working women population in india, bore the brunt of hate campaigns, hiring biases, and state-sanctioned demolition drives.\nwe spoke with nonprofit leaders and activists working with muslim women workers in india and found that even though all women from the community faced challenges in finding and sustaining employment, their struggles varied based on factors such as their socio-economic status, level of education, and the sector they were employed in.\nmuslim women from the middle and upper classes with higher education degrees did comparatively better and even saw some positive developments during the pandemic, while those from low-income groups struggled for money and had to start working to make up for the loss of family income. the migrant workers in the informal sector were the most disadvantaged because in addition to the other challenges, they lacked a social security net. in a way, the pandemic again showed that even within the marginalised communities, one's social location plays a critical role in defining lives and livelihoods.\na section of the population fared better\ndeepanjali lahiri, chief operating officer of ledby foundation--an incubator that works on building leadership among college-educated muslim women--thinks covid-19 had a positive impact on the people they work with. she says, \"while the pandemic has had many other repercussions, remote work has actually played out quite well for the ledby cohorts. many of the women we work with had restrictions on their travel earlier. during the lockdowns, a number of them said, 'i am able to work comfortably because i can do it from home.'\"\nsince the pandemic made remote work a possibility, young muslim women from tier-i and tier-ii cities--whose families were otherwise wary of letting them go to metropolitan areas in search of work--were able to tap into the job market. in fact, the participants of ledby's leadership programme continue to negotiate for remote and hybrid work even as employers are reopening physical offices. deepanjali worries that as jobs go offline again, seeking employment may be difficult for hijabi muslim women as some employers have previously asked them to do away with the hijab at workplaces.\nhowever, only a fraction of the muslim population in india has the higher education required for formal sector jobs, where employees have the luxury of remote work. the majority of muslims in the country are employed in the informal sector, where there are fewer choices and safeguards.\ndemolition and job losses changed low-income muslim neighbourhoods\nmuslim women workers faced targeted campaigns that accused the minority community of waging 'corona jihad'--wilfully spreading the covid-19 virus among people from other religions. there were calls for the economic and social boycott of muslims. a study on the effects of the first lockdown on informal women workers in punjab documented several instances of islamophobia. it noted that a muslim woman who ran a grocery store with her husband reported incurring losses during the pandemic because of social ostracisation.\nthe community also suffered due to the 'anti-encroachment drives' that became a norm during this time in states such as delhi, uttar pradesh, and madhya pradesh. while the governments stated that these were meant to clear the footpaths and streets, critics pointed out that the demolitions indiscriminately targeted low-income muslim neighbourhoods.\nshabnam nafisa kalim, the founder of khair help foundation--a nonprofit that works on education and women's empowerment in areas such as delhi's jahangirpuri--says, \"there were five or six women who would set up stalls to sell perfumes and such items in the market. so at the time of the demolition, whatever they were selling also got bulldozed along with the stalls. and 15-20 thelas (carts) of kebab, biryani, etc. were also damaged.\"\nthe women of the family came together to supplement the men's income.\nas the neighbourhoods faced the double salvo of pandemic and loss of property, incomes plummeted. according to shabnam, \"families that previously had a monthly income of inr 15,000 had to make do with inr 10,000. those who had been making inr 10,000 were not even able to make inr 5,000.\"\nthere were instances where the women of the family came together to supplement the men's income. shabnam cites the example of a woman in north east delhi's khajoori khas area. she started earning during the lockdown and ran the household by stitching denims and processing bulk orders of clothes. shabnam says, \"for six months, she and her daughter ran the household before her husband took up driving an e-rickshaw in 2022.\" during the lockdowns, more muslim women--even in low-income households--started working, and many of them continue to do so. shabnam adds, \"even those who didn't work earlier, and whose husbands were the sole breadwinners, are now working. it has become fifty-fifty.\"\nkhair help foundation works in muslim neighbourhoods where women are self-employed. since their businesses serve the locals, they don't face religious discrimination in the way that muslims working in non-muslim areas do. but what about the migrant muslim women workers who not only deal with religious persecution but are also invisibilised in government records and left out of welfare programmes?\nthe migrant muslim women workers suffer from error of omission. | picture courtesy: jp davidson / cc by\nmigrant muslim women remained invisible\nshreya ghosh, a member of sangrami gharelu kamgar union (a domestic workers' union active in north india) and migrant workers solidarity network, says, \"most of the migrant muslim women are employed in domestic work such as cooking and cleaning, and a few of them are in garment manufacturing and construction. in fact, 65-70 percent of domestic workers in our union are muslim, and the rest are mostly dalit.\"\ndomestic workers were among those most affected by the lockdowns. they faced job losses as movement was restricted and even criminalised and, according to a survey conducted in eight states of india in 2020, 85 percent of them went without pay.\nduring the lockdowns, there were many reported incidents of domestic workers facing extra surveillance and increased violence and abuse.\nshreya says, \"since migrant muslim women are mostly employed as domestic workers, this also meant that they suffered more.\"\nduring the lockdowns, there were many reported incidents of domestic workers facing extra surveillance and increased violence and abuse. shreya says, \"in gated communities, it was mandatory for the domestic workers to pass through sanitising shower counters. residents were not asked to do that. this definitely meant that you were considering the domestic worker to be the carrier of the virus.\"\naccording to shreya, employers prefer to hire migrant domestic workers because they charge less and often stick around. \"at the height of covid-19 and reverse migration into villages, the domestic workers stayed back. some waited for six months, others up to a year in the hope that things will go back to normal. despite their struggle for food and rent in their adopted cities, they didn't leave because back home they have no land to cultivate, nor the resources to start a small business,\" adds shreya.\nwhat's the future of work for muslim women?\nthe situation for domestic workers, and by extension migrant muslim women workers, is not likely to improve even though covid-19 no longer restricts movement in the same way. their struggles will continue because they lack the protection of labour laws. since 1959, several bills that would ensure basic safeguards such as fair wage, pension, and maternity and health benefits to domestic workers have been introduced in the parliament. but none of them were passed as a law.\nthe migrant muslim women workers also suffer from error of omission. according to the 2011 census survey, 67 percent of the migrating population are women, and an estimated 11 percent of the women migrate with their families. this data doesn't show that many of these women who migrate with their husbands and families continue to work, even if they don't often see themselves as breadwinners. \"if you ask the domestic workers they will say, 'we have migrated because our husbands migrated,' but they are all working women. it is a larger question of how women's labour is understood in our society,\" says shreya.\nthere isn't enough data on interstate migration in india and the government failed to collect crucial information about loss of jobs and workers' deaths during the pandemic. another critical gap is the lack of research on how identities impact livelihoods. without data, how will government schemes, policies, and welfare benefits reach the population?\nno one is doing in-depth research on muslim women in the workforce.\nshreya suggests it is a wilful omission. \"the government doesn't count them because it doesn't want to hamper the industries that are benefitting from the large-scale migration from some states to the special economic zones. they want the labour to be seen as a mass rather than individual citizens with their own set of challenges.\"\nthis lack of research is not limited to migrants. in 2022, led by published a study on hiring biases against muslim women in entry-level jobs. deepanjali says, \"we took up the study because we were tired of saying there's no actual data. no one is doing in-depth research [on muslim women in the workforce]. for example, there is no research on the challenges hijabi women face at work in india, even though there are studies abroad that show rampant discrimination against them.\"\nnonprofits believe that only the government has the bandwidth to undertake research at a scale in line with india's vast and diverse geography and demography. shreya says, \"while we work among the workers, we don't have the kind of resources and reach that you need to conduct a comprehensive survey. it is the government's job. even the most resourceful nonprofits can't undertake the kind of surveys that the government office can.\"\n--\nknow more",

    Title:
      'why so many biharis still work as labourers in tamil nadu, punjab and other states',
    Article:
      "a few days ago, misleading videos surfaced on social media with claims that migrant workers from bihar were being attacked in tamil nadu, triggering panic and a temporary exodus of part of the workforce.\na quick investigation showed that what was seen in the visuals had taken place earlier, some of it even outside tamil nadu. the police registered cases, made some arrests for spreading misinformation and asked social media giants to do damage control.\nadvertisement\nalso read | 'centre should intervene': tejashwi on reports of attack on bihar migrants in tamil nadu\na team of senior bihar officials also reached the southern state and met their counterparts and representatives of migrant workers. both chief ministers had to issue \"all is well\" statements and an appeal for calm.\nhowever, the scare has, in its wake, raised an old question: why are lakhs of bihari workers still forced to leave home and sweat it out in tamil nadu, punjab and other states? especially after years of the so-called sushasan (good governance) of chief minister nitish kumar.\nthe quick answer is: when nitish kumar took over in 2005, bihar had the highest unemployment rate in the country. he promised to change the scene and keep biharis from moving out in search of livelihood. in 2022, it only had jammu & kashmir and rajasthan behind it. the scale of bihar's migrant crisis burst into public view when over 15 lakh workers ran helter-skelter to get home during the 2020 covid-19 pandemic.\nin 2005, the poverty rate in bihar was 54.5 per cent. it was the poorest state in the country. nitish kumar promised to eradicate poverty. today, bihar remains the poorest state. the poverty rate is 51.9 per cent. as per a niti aayog report, over half of bihar's population is multidimensionally poor.\nalso read | bihar, jharkhand, up poorest states in india: niti aayog's poverty index\naccording to data from the centre for monitoring indian economy (cmie), bihar's unemployment rate in february 2023 rose to 12.3 per cent, while the national figure was 7.5 per cent. however, states such as haryana, rajasthan and jharkhand fared worse than bihar.\nmuch is blamed on the rjd's so-called jungle raj. but even before lalu yadav began his highly controversial rule of bihar in 1990, the state, with high population growth, had always been underdeveloped and poorly governed.\nilliterate and barely educated young men were forced to move out to work as farm labourers, construction and sanitation workers, hawkers, watchmen, dhobis, rickshaw pullers, auto-rickshaw drivers and now lift attendants. along with populous states like uttar pradesh, bihar had a surplus labour force for industrially developing maharashtra, gujarat, tamil nadu and karnataka or agriculturally progressing punjab and haryana. before that, kolkata was a strong pull for job-seekers.\nadvertisement\nthe change, with lalu's arrival, was that the other backward classes (obcs), primarily the yadavs, had political patronage to cock a snook at the earlier exploiting establishment composed of the so-called upper castes. political instability was taken care of, but the annual flooding stayed and crime and corruption spiralled. so did joblessness.\nwhen nitish kumar came to power in 2005, there was hope. there was a media blitz of sushasan, but things did not change much. swollen rivers in monsoon continue to ravage vast swathes of land and joblessness remains a significant socio-political issue. this is both despite and because of his sharing power, in instalments, with prime minister narendra modi's bjp and lalu yadav's rjd.\ntoday, punjab's agriculture, and also industries to a large extent, is massively dependent on lakhs of bihari labourers clustered in bathinda, amritsar, jalandhar and ludhiana. they're the people more willing to clean cattle sheds or do menial labour in factories without asking for too much. the migration has dropped due to greater availability of some jobs in rural pockets in bihar but this drop has been marginal. today, many of delhi's auto-rickshaw drivers and rickshaw pullers are from bihar districts such as motihari, gopalganj, darbhanga and samastipur.\nadvertisement\nalso read | from landowners to labourers: the curious case of small farmers from bihar, up\nnitish kumar takes pride in the high growth rate of the state's gdp. but have you ever heard america growing at an 8 per cent rate? only the poorest of the poor have the potential to grow faster. a person earning rs 10 would see a 10 per cent growth rate if she earns rs 11.\nbut it's not only about numbers. there are social aspects to the crisis as well. there is an inherent aspiration that one must work and work hard. and there's also this common refrain: yahan scope nahi hai (there aren't enough opportunities here).\nthen, there's a call that comes from outside, the call of greener pastures, that the situation is better outside bihar. this call is reinforced by those returning home during chhath, other festivals or family functions or social gatherings, who wear jeans, carry smartphones and bring home saved-up money.\nwhen fresh batches of the majboor and the inspired go out, they find the pastures, in slums, are not at all greener. you pay rent, you buy food, you're the usual suspects when crime happens. you're also victims of anti-migrant rhetoric and violence. so, what explains this pull? it's the pull of anonymity.\nadvertisement\nif one has to do so-called menial jobs in patna or darbhanga, where one has grown up and studied, there's this issue of shame. log kya kahenge? the urge is for societally conditioned respectability. the tragedy is, that respectability can only be found in the anonymity of, say, mumbai's chawls. the consolation is: wahan kaun dekhne jayega?\nalso read | stalin speaks to nitish, assures safety of bihar migrant workers in tamil nadu | top points\nit's also tragic that society has respect for luxury and not for labour. is it any surprise that those employing servants and driving cars even in mufassil bihar have people's respect? this gulf is seen to have been bridged, though marginally, when a migrant worker returns home and his daughter's birthday has dj music and a cake-cutting ceremony, with people clapping on, betraying awe, admiration and envy.\nthe problem is, the bihar government is struggling to create jobs for today's adults but isn't planning for today's children who would need employment in a few years.\nthis is part of the reason we have such massive backlogs. the planning that the government is doing should have been done years ago. no wonder, some of the familiar visuals coming out of bihar are of job-seeking youngsters torching trains or being thrashed by the police. or migrant workers scrambling for safety even at the slightest of alarm.",
    Summary:
      "A team of senior bihar officials reached the southern state and met their counterparts and representatives of migrant workers. The scale of bihar's migrant crisis burst into public view when over 15 lakh workers ran helter-skelter to get home during the 2020 covid-19 pandemic. Over half of Bihar's population is multidimensionally poor. The migration has dropped due to greater availability of some jobs in rural pockets in bihar. But this drop has been marginal. The Migration has dropped. But the migration has also dropped. The migrants have been marginal, but the migration is still marginal. There is also a lack of jobs in northern states such as haryana, rajasthan and jharkhand and other states like uttar pradesh.",

      "last week, social media platforms were thronged with alleged rumors of migrant workers being fatally assaulted in tamil nadu. while the officials were quick to dismiss the violence laden videos as fake, there is no denying the fact that such attacks have been a sad reality in the past. the tamil nadu chief minister and the governor quickly shifted to damage control mode and called their state 'safe for migrant labourers' but that wasn't enough to stop thousands of migrants workers from fleeing the state in packed trains. this is reminiscent of the large scale reverse migration of workers to their home states during the covid-19 lockdown three years ago that caused significant disruptions in the state's economic activity. despite the migrant workers being the supposed backbone of many high income states, why do they always have to face the same fate and disrupt their lives every few months?\nyour turn is a unique section from theprint featuring points of view from its subscribers. if you are a subscriber, have a point of view, please send it to us. if not, do subscribe here: https://theprint.in/subscribe/\ndo we have adequate laws to protect interstate labourers?\nas per the inter-state migrant workmen act, 1979, the establishment which proposes to employ migrant workers is required to be registered with destination states. the contractors are also bound to get a licence from the concerned authority of both the states involved - home state and the destination state. the act applies to all establishment employing five or more migrant workmen from other states; or if it had employed five or more such workmen on any day in the preceding 12 months. but like most other well meaning laws, the issues are in the implementation.\nwhat has the government been up to?\nthe ministry of labour and employment proposed developing a national database of unorganised workers (nduw), connected to their aadhaar. this will ensure that the government is able to extend the benefits of the social security schemes to these workers as effectively as possible. there is no dearth of welfare schemes for the workers. some of them include pradhan mantri garib kalyan yojana, garib kalyan rojgar abhiyan, pradhan mantri svanidhi scheme, one nation one ration card, etc.\nlabour bureau has been tasked with conducting the all india survey on migrant workers, as shared by minister of state for labour and employment recently in the lok sabha. not just this, the ministry of minority affairs, department of empowerment of persons with disabilities, ministry of labour & employment, and some other ministries provide scholarships to different target groups of students including children of migrant workers through the national scholarship portal.\nin 2021, jharkhand rolled out the 'safe and responsible migration initiative' (srmi), for systemic registration of migrant workers. the aim is to be able to track and map the labourers who decide to move out to other states for work. jharkhand government is also planning to set up help desks, called the 'labour consulates' in various states with a significant population of jharkhand workers.\n'stateless' indians?\nas per the figures from 2011 census, total internal migrants in india are close to 45 crore, including 5.4 crore inter-state migrants. this number is highly underestimated. most of these workers lose out on their most basic democratic right - right to vote which is bound by residency criteria, resulting in their disenfranchisement. it is not fair to expect these migrants workers to go back to their home states just to vote. unsurprisingly, the 2019 lok sabha elections saw the lowest voter turnout in labour exporting states of bihar and uttar pradesh - 57.33% and 59.21% respectively, much below the national average of 67.4%.\nexisting laws allow people to get themselves registered at their place of \"ordinary residence\", but it is extremely difficult for the migrant labourers to get residence proof for this purpose. thus, they are not a hefty enough 'vote bank' in most cases for either their home state or the host state to take them seriously enough. fortunately, the election commission of india has proposed the introduction of remote voting facility for migrant workers with the help of remote voting machines. electronic corporation of india ltd., the manufacturer of the electronic voting machines, has already developed a prototype of a multi-constituency remote evm (rvm) which would be capable of handling 72 constituencies in a single remote polling booth. however, progress on the implementation front is nowhere near satisfactory.\nwhile the government has left no stone unturned to extend the olive branch to the nris, inviting them to the a part of well planned glitzy events, often led by the prime minister himself, the time has come to give equal respect to our domestic migrants since the new india will be built on their sweat and blood.\nthese pieces are being published as they have been received - they have not been edited/fact-checked by theprint.\nalso read: subscriberwrites: norway's success story can be blueprint for india's sustainable growth",

      "chennai: the manufacturing sector is the engine for tamil nadu 's ambitious $1 trillion economy goals, but guest or migrant workers will power it. the state will need a workforce of 1. 3 crore in the manufacturing sector alone over a decade. of them, at least 50 lakh are expected to be guest workers, say industry executives and state officials.large enterprises and msmes in tamil nadu face a deficit of blue collar workers as locals aspire for more skilled jobs.so, industry wants the state to come up with steps to make migrant workers more welcome. the issue has become even more pressing after the recent trouble sparked by fake videos of attacks on guest workers.speaking at cii's 'advancing tamil nadu's rise' conference last week, b santhanam, ceoasia pacific & india region & md chairman, saint gobain india, said about 47 lakh people are employed in manufacturing in tamil nadu. \"if manufacturing and construction is going to increase from $100 billion to $400 billion, the number of employees needed will increase to 1. 3 crore. in such a scenario, there will be a deficit of 50 lakh workers and they have to come from other states. that's where the issue of migrant labourers is crucial. \"pooja kulkarni , special secretary, industries, investment promotion & commerce department, government of tamil nadu, acknowledged that growth of tn's economy is largely powered by these workers. \"the manufacturing sector will contribute $250 billion in the $1 trillion economy that the state is targeting,\" she said.the biggest issue in ensuring the welfare of migrant labourers is the absence of comprehensive data on their numbers. as per census 2011, tn had around 34. 8 lakh guest workers, compared to 30. 4 lakh guest workers in gujarat and more than 79 lakh in maharashtra. districtwise migration data in the economic survey for 2016-17 puts tiruvallur, chennai, kancheepuram, erode, and coimbatore among the top district-cities for high net inward migration. the union ministry of labour and employment is now putting together a comprehensive national database of the unorganised workers.headhunters and staffing firms working with industrial units in the state estimate that, on an average, almost 40% of employees of tn companies are from outside the state. historically, the state's own labour force is more keen to upskill and does not take up non-skilled jobs, says aditya mishra , ceo, ciel hr services. \"companies too prefer a healthy mix of migrants in the workforce since it reduces absenteeism and leads to better employee relations too,\" he adds.tirupur, the knitwear cluster with an annual business of more than 75,000 crore, employs six lakh workers. ofthem, nearly 50% are guest workers. raja m shanmugam, former president of tirupur exporters association, says that the garments export hub will require more than one million employees by 2030 as the number of units is expanding. \"the share of migrant labourers working in the tirupur garment factories and ancillary units will be 60%,\" he says. more housing and facilities for children's education are needed to woo migrant workers to help the state reach its $1 trillion goal, he adds.the state's construction industry is another major contributor to the economy that hosts a large proportion of migrant workers. s sridharan, director lyra properties & chairman (urban development and housing), credai-national, says, tamil nadu will require at least 15 lakh guest workers in the construction sector in about a decade. \"executing construction projects in the absence of migrant labourers will be difficult considering the volume of real estate growth the state will witness in the coming years,\" he says.startup projecthero , which operates a tech marketplace for construction workers to connect with contractors, says that of the 7,042 workers registered with it in the state, just 1,500 (20%) are locals.the centre for monitoring indian economy (cmie) says the local labour force participation rate in tamil nadu has been shrinking from 2016 to 2022. it was 56% in march 2016, and between 2016 and 2022, the participation rate fell by 20 percentage points to around 36%.r geetha, adviser, unorganised workers' federation, says, tamil nadu should provide adequate welfare facilities for migrant labourers moving to the state to keep them coming.",
